[04:16] <http402> Your connection got nuked and you've met your match.

[04:24] <http402> I'd pass the torch to a real winner
[04:28] <http402> But it'd just scorch a while-loop spinner
[04:32] <http402> Caught in a loop that you cant escape,
[04:36] <http402> I run clock cycles around your words and flows,
[04:40] <http402> Cuz your rhyme is like a PS fan: it blows,

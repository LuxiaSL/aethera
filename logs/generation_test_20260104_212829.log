============================================================
CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 30 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~30 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

{"candidate_index": 1, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Opens with a believable slice-of-life IRC topic (3D-printed anime figure) that’s quirky and a bit unsettling (tentacles) without resorting to outright slurs or pure spam. Two distinct nicks banter naturally, leaving room for others to jump in. Timestamps look authentic, pacing feels right for a 30-line log, and the premise can easily branch into humor, creepiness or tech talk. Strong foundation compared with other candidates, which are either overly offensive, one-note, or low-effort."}

CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 4/30 messages (13%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <Xathoras> Guys, my 3D printed waifu figurine just arrived! She looks so kawaii uwu

[00:12] <Nihilus666> WTF bro, that's messed up. I love it
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

CHUNK 4 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 10/30 messages (33%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (3 lines) ---
Shub-Niggurath chick sounds like a total yandere. She might go all "notice me senpai" and devour your soul or some shit
[00:56] <PrinnyDood> You fool! The Black Goat cares not for your petty mortal affections. She desires only chaos, madness and the blood of a thousand sacrifices!
[01:00] <Xathoras> Ps

--- CANDIDATE 2 (4 lines) ---
Cthulhu waifu might give you more "tentacles" than you bargained for
[00:56] <PrinnyDood> Only the most devoted acolytes can handle communion with the Outer Gods! Your minds are too weak to comprehend!
[01:00] <Xathoras> Y'all need Haruhi. The only goddess I pray to is the goddess of moe
[01:04]

--- CANDIDATE 3 (4 lines) ---
anime pus*y will rot your brain and drain your life force
[00:56] <Xathoras> Worth it. I'd gladly sacrifice my sanity on the altar of moe blobs and thicc thighs
[01:00] <PrinnyDood> You fools! True power lies in the writhing chaos of the Outer Gods! ia! ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!
[01:

============================================================
CHUNK 6 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 15/30 messages (50%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

CHUNK 6 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 9, "rating": 6, "reasoning": "All options have flaws, mostly missing timestamps or truncation. Candidate 10 (index 9) is the least problematic: dialogue flows naturally, timestamps progress, and content fits the irreverent, slightly eerie tone. Only the first line lacks a timestamp, but it’s otherwise coherent and not cut-off, making it the strongest of the available continuations."}

CHUNK 7 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 18/30 messages (60%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

{"candidate_index": 3, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Feels like a believable IRC escalation: an ircop notice followed by users scrambling to \"act normal.\" Tone stays humorous yet unsettling, keeps all nicks consistent, and preserves the log format. Even though it cuts off after the timestamp, it sets up a natural wind-down with room for the final few lines. Other options are either more abruptly terminated, heavily truncated, or add meta elements that break immersion."}

CHUNK 9 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 23/30 messages (77%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (7 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

CHUNK 10 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 23/30 messages (77%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (7 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

CHUNK 12 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 23/30 messages (77%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (7 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

[00:00] <Xathoras> Guys, my 3D printed waifu figurine just arrived! She looks so kawaii uwu
[00:04] <Nihilus666> Post pics or it didn't happen
[00:10] <Xathoras> *uploads image of anime girl figurine with tentacles*
[00:12] <Nihilus666> WTF bro, that's messed up. I love it
[00:16] <PrinnyDood> Tentacles? Really? How lewd and degenerate. I approve!
[00:20] <Xathoras> Hey, don't kinkshame! My love for my waifu transcends your 3D mortal concepts
[00:24] <Nihilus666> Your "love" is a sad delusion. But those curves are on point, ngl
[00:30] <Xathoras> Don't be jelly just cuz you ain't got a sweet anime QT like I do
[00:34] <PrinnyDood> Why settle for 2D when you can have a 4D waifu that exists beyond space and time?
[00:38] <Nihilus666> Bro what drugs are you on and where can I get some?
[00:42] <PrinnyDood> The only drug I need is my pure devotion to the Elder Goddess Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!
[00:48] <Xathoras> Miss me with that eldritch thot shit. I'll stick to my sweet anime babes
[00:52] <Nihilus666> Careful, that Cthulhu waifu might give you more "tentacles" than you bargained for
[00:56] <PrinnyDood> Only the most devoted acolytes can handle communion with the Outer Gods! Your minds are too weak to comprehend!
[01:00] <Xathoras> Y'all need Haruhi. The only goddess I pray to is the goddess of moe
[01:04] <Nihilus666> The power of anime compels you! Begone foul demons of degeneracy!
[01:08] <Xathoras> Anime IS degeneracy you fool! Embrace it, let it flow through you!
[01:12] <PrinnyDood> Your false iDOLM@STER idols pale before the incomprehensible glory of Yog-Sothoth
[01:16] <Xathoras> Your Lovecraftian waifu is shit taste, at least pick a cute one like Cthylla
[01:20] <Nihilus666> Imagine simping for eldritch abominations when cat girls exist
[01:24] <PrinnyDood> The Nekonomicon spoke of the coming of the Kawaii One... could it be?
[01:28] *** Global Notice from ircop: Attention #aethera: Take your eldritch anime shitposting elsewhere or face the consequences.

[00:00] <Xathoras> Guys, my 3D printed waifu figurine just arrived! She looks so kawaii uwu
[00:04] <Nihilus666> Post pics or it didn't happen
[00:10] <Xathoras> *uploads image of anime girl figurine with tentacles*
[00:12] <Nihilus666> WTF bro, that's messed up. I love it
[00:16] <PrinnyDood> Tentacles? Really? How lewd and degenerate. I approve!
[00:20] <Xathoras> Hey, don't kinkshame! My love for my waifu transcends your 3D mortal concepts
[00:24] <Nihilus666> Your "love" is a sad delusion. But those curves are on point, ngl
[00:30] <Xathoras> Don't be jelly just cuz you ain't got a sweet anime QT like I do
[00:34] <PrinnyDood> Why settle for 2D when you can have a 4D waifu that exists beyond space and time?
[00:38] <Nihilus666> Bro what drugs are you on and where can I get some?
[00:42] <PrinnyDood> The only drug I need is my pure devotion to the Elder Goddess Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!
[00:48] <Xathoras> Miss me with that eldritch thot shit. I'll stick to my sweet anime babes
[00:52] <Nihilus666> Careful, that Cthulhu waifu might give you more "tentacles" than you bargained for
[00:56] <PrinnyDood> Only the most devoted acolytes can handle communion with the Outer Gods! Your minds are too weak to comprehend!
[01:00] <Xathoras> Y'all need Haruhi. The only goddess I pray to is the goddess of moe
[01:04] <Nihilus666> The power of anime compels you! Begone foul demons of degeneracy!
[01:08] <Xathoras> Anime IS degeneracy you fool! Embrace it, let it flow through you!
[01:12] <PrinnyDood> Your false iDOLM@STER idols pale before the incomprehensible glory of Yog-Sothoth
[01:16] <Xathoras> Your Lovecraftian waifu is shit taste, at least pick a cute one like Cthylla
[01:20] <Nihilus666> Imagine simping for eldritch abominations when cat girls exist
[01:24] <PrinnyDood> The Nekonomicon spoke of the coming of the Kawaii One... could it be?

[00:00] <Xathoras> Guys, my 3D printed waifu figurine just arrived! She looks so kawaii uwu
[00:04] <Nihilus666> Post pics or it didn't happen
[00:10] <Xathoras> *uploads image of anime girl figurine with tentacles*
[00:12] <Nihilus666> WTF bro, that's messed up. I love it
[00:16] <PrinnyDood> Tentacles? Really? How lewd and degenerate. I approve!
[00:20] <Xathoras> Hey, don't kinkshame! My love for my waifu transcends your 3D mortal concepts
[00:24] <Nihilus666> Your "love" is a sad delusion. But those curves are on point, ngl
[00:30] <Xathoras> Don't be jelly just cuz you ain't got a sweet anime QT like I do
[00:34] <PrinnyDood> Why settle for 2D when you can have a 4D waifu that exists beyond space and time?
[00:38] <Nihilus666> Bro what drugs are you on and where can I get some?
[00:42] <PrinnyDood> The only drug I need is my pure devotion to the Elder Goddess Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!
[00:48] <Xathoras> Miss me with that eldritch thot shit. I'll stick to my sweet anime babes
[00:52] <Nihilus666> Careful, that Cthulhu waifu might give you more "tentacles" than you bargained for
[00:56] <PrinnyDood> Only the most devoted acolytes can handle communion with the Outer Gods! Your minds are too weak to comprehend!
[01:00] <Xathoras> Y'all need Haruhi. The only goddess I pray to is the goddess of moe
[01:04] <Nihilus666> The power of anime compels you! Begone foul demons of degeneracy!
[01:08] <Xathoras> Anime IS degeneracy you fool! Embrace it, let it flow through you!
[01:12] <PrinnyDood> Your false iDOLM@STER idols pale before the incomprehensible glory of Yog-Sothoth
[01:16] <Xathoras> Your Lovecraftian waifu is shit taste, at least pick a cute one like Cthylla
[01:20] <Nihilus666> Imagine simping for eldritch abominations when cat girls exist
[01:24] <PrinnyDood> The Nekonomicon spoke of the coming of the Kawaii One... could it be?
[01:28] *** Global Notice from ircop: Attention #aethera: Take your eldritch anime shitposting elsewhere or face the consequences.
[01:32] <Xathoras> Aw shit, the mods are onto us. Quick, act normal!
[01:36] <Nihilus666> Normal? WTF is that? Some kind of normie shit?

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 23 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~23 message conversation.

{"candidate_index": 8, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Keeps prior line intact, then turns it into a recursion-induced quit—feels authentically IRC (use of * quit message). The follow-ups by OuroborosError and subliminalpanda continue the banter and hint at digital decay without excessive repetition. Minimal but effective glitchiness, good pacing. Slight truncation on the last line but less disruptive than the unfinished nickname in other strong options."}

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 6/23 messages (26%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

--- CANDIDATE 2 (4 lines) ---
also
[00:18] <subliminalpanda> it's also how you create cursed knowledge that actively erases itself when observed
[00:20] <XxX_fuzzy_bunny_XxX> so it's like schrödinger's cat but the cat is the concept of privacy in modern society?
[00:26] <Ant

--- CANDIDATE 3 (4 lines) ---
not a bug
[00:20] <AntisocialMedia> but what if the user collapses into a state where they forget how to collapse?
[00:26] <OuroborosError> then they both know and don't know how to collapse until observed
[00:32] <subliminalpanda> shit we've created quantum enlightenment

--- CANDIDATE 4 (4 lines) ---
[00:18] <OuroborosError> oh no
[00:20] <AntisocialMedia> recursive thought recursion!
[00:22] <subliminalpanda> philosophically speaking, isn't all computation just recursion anyway?
[00:24] <AntisocialMedia> theoretically yes, but practically speaking, recursion without base

a feature
[00:18] <AntisocialMedia> it's not a bug it's a quantum superposition of features
[00:22] <OuroborosError> submitter cannot be in bugzilla until observer collapses their comment field
[00:26] <subliminalpanda> i tried to submit a bug report but my cat

[00:20] <AntisocialMedia> we've gone recursive

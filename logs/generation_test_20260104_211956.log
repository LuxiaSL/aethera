CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 30 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~30 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

{"candidate_index": 7, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Candidate 7 opens with several distinct nicks, a mix of ops and regular users, an action line, and cryptic Discordian slogans. It feels like genuine IRC banter while sowing a slightly cult-like, unsettling tone that can branch into many directions. The dense timestamp stack and abrupt cut-off add a hint of digital glitch/decay without breaking readability. Overall it offers the richest foundation for an extended, 30-line fragment."}

[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this
[01:14] <Thirteen-> will do. you better hope he's not still buried, you'll be in deep shit.

CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 6/30 messages (20%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <xplodnstar> i am going to be rich
[00:04] <xplodnstar> when imake a device that texts you the name of the song

[00:21] <xplod
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Adds a new voice responding plausibly to xplodnstar’s ramble, keeps the quirky/decayed vibe (typos, caps drift, abrupt quit), introduces another nick to keep conversation alive, and feels like real IRC pacing. Minor formatting glitches actually fit the ‘digital decay’ theme. Other candidates are either too short, nonsensical, or break flow more severely."}

============================================================
CHUNK 4 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 15/30 messages (50%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <xplodnstar> i am going to be rich
[00:04] <xplodnstar> when imake a device that texts you the name of the song
[00:08] <xplodnstar> that you're thinking of

[01:02] <Arbor
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

Continues the 'digital decay' vibe and references earlier sendq issues. Formatting is plausible; abrupt cutoff matches existing style. Other candidates have missing nicks, odd slurs, or less coherent flow."}

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 23/30 messages (77%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (7 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

CHUNK 5 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 3, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Provides a plausible follow-up to the spam: Arbor continues glitchy fragments, then two participants get kicked for Excess Flood, which fits IRC realism and the digital-decay vibe. It uses exactly seven lines, brings a natural lull toward an ending, and introduces minimal new text without endless repetition. Minor issue: first three Arbor lines are nonsense, but they read like corrupted paste, so acceptable."}

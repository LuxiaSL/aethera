CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 23 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~23 message conversation.

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 9/23 messages (39%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <xXvoidwalkerXx> guys i think my mass spectrometer is haunted
[00:06] <labrat99> what
[00:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> it keeps detecting an element that doesn't exist
[00:18] <labrat99> what do you mean doesn't exist
[00:24] <xXvoidwalkerXx> like atomic number 141 [00: like atomic number 141
[00:30] <labrat99> that's impossible the periodic table only goes up to 118
[00:36] <cryptid_hunter> wait what's the mass reading
[00:42] <xXvoidwalkerXx> that's the thing, it keeps changing
[00:48] <xXvoidwalkerXx> 372... 373... 371... like it's breathing
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length


            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't just detect things that aren't there
[01:00] <labrat99> did you calibrate it recently
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> YES i calibrated it three times today because of this
[01:12] <cryptid_hunter> what sample are you running
[01:18] <xXvoidwalkerXx> that

--- CANDIDATE 2 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> spectrometers don't just invent elements dude
[01:00] <cryptid_hunter> unless something's interfering with the detector
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> i thought that too so i ran diagnostics three times
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> all clean
[01:18] <labrat99> what

--- CANDIDATE 3 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't just invent elements dude
[01:00] <labrat99> you probably have contamination
[01:06] <cryptid_hunter> or something WANTS you to think its contamination
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> i've run calibration 6 times
[01:18] <xXvoidwalkerXx>

--- CANDIDATE 4 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't "breathe" dude you probably have a calibration issue
[01:00] <cryptid_hunter> or a contamination in your sample chamber
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> i've recalibrated it six times
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> and i cleaned the chamber. twice.
[01

--- CANDIDATE 5 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't work like that
[00:58] <labrat99> you're probably getting contamination or something
[01:04] <cryptid_hunter> or SOMETHING
[01:08] <xXvoidwalkerXx> no listen i cleaned the chamber three times
[01:14] <xXvoidwalkerXx> the readings only show up after midnight

--- CANDIDATE 6 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't just invent elements dude
[01:00] <labrat99> did you calibrate it recently
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> three times today
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> after the third time it printed "STOP THAT"
[01:18] <labrat99> printed where???

--- CANDIDATE 7 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't "breathe" dude clean your ionization chamber
[01:00] <cryptid_hunter> no wait don't touch it
[01:06] <cryptid_hunter> what's the sample
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> that's the other thing
[01:18] <xXvoidwalkerXx> there IS no

--- CANDIDATE 8 (6 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't just invent elements lol
[01:00] <labrat99> probably contamination or calibration drift
[01:06] <cryptid_hunter> no wait i've seen this before
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> ???
[01:18] <cryptid_hunter> what sample were you running
[01:24] <x

--- CANDIDATE 9 (5 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> mass specs don't just invent elements dude
[01:00] <labrat99> did you calibrate it recently
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> YES i calibrated it this morning
[01:12] <xXvoidwalkerXx> and it only does this at night
[01:18] <cryptid_hunter> at night?

--- CANDIDATE 10 (6 lines) ---
[00:54] <labrat99> instruments don't breathe dude
[01:00] <cryptid_hunter> unless something else is
[01:06] <xXvoidwalkerXx> not helping
[01:12] <labrat99> have you tried recalibrating
[01:18] <xXvoidwalkerXx> three times
[01:24] <xXvoidwal

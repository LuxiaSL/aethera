[00:00] <DeadMansHand> haha, last night, me and pete went out to celebrate his engagement and got hugely drunk
[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this
[01:14] <Thirteen-> will do. you better hope he's not still buried, you'll be in deep shit.
[01:18] *** DeadMansHand has quit
[01:32] <Tyran> wtf? pete came home last night you fuck. Ken's going to be worrying about this shit all day
[01:40] <Thirteen-> haha yea, but it will be fun while it lasts
[01:52] *** PeteRepeat has joined
[01:56] <PeteRepeat> fucking ken
[02:04] <PeteRepeat> ken... that fucker buried me in the sand last night, i ran off about 5 minutes to it, left him there to be an idiot
[02:18] <quiqsilver> pete, ken didn't come back last night, i thought he was with you.
[02:24] <PeteRepeat> oh fuck.
[02:32] <PeteRepeat> if ken shows up, make sure he doesn't know that im at the beach digging for his body. i don't want him to think i care or anything.
[02:36] *** PeteRepeat has quit
[02:48] <Thirteen-> rofl. Those 2 are going to get a huge surprise when they meet at the beach.

JUDGE PROMPT (FULL)
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            Context: We're simulating a haunted IRC channel called #aethera. The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            Your task: Rate these candidates and select the best one to continue the story.
            The winning candidate will be used to generate the next chunk.

            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (6 lines) ---

{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Feels more like an organic IRC exchange: multiple users, slang, timestamps, and an unfinished line that could hint at lag or decay. Mentions a creepy sighting, adding mild unease. Formatting is a bit inconsistent but comparable to #aethera style.

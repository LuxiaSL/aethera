[00:28] <Rabidplaybunny87> So we all went running to see what was up, and our neighbor's house was on fire!
[00:34] <GarbageStan23> oh shit!
[00:44] <Rabidplaybunny87> Yeah, and when we got there, the wife was crying into her husbands arms, and we were just kinda standing there, and then she saw us, and then like for 10 seconds, gave us the dirtiest look ever

============================================================
CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 17 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~17 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

CHUNK 6 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 19/17 messages (112%) ===

            We're at the END (-2 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

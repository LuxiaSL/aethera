[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here
[05:12] <Galactic> it's just always bothered me.

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 17 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~17 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

{"candidate_index": 5, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Feels like a genuine IRC back-and-forth: short bursts, timestamps correct, a newcomer joins, escalation is creepy (the rice-cooker UDP stream decodes to 9/11 audio). Tone is unsettling yet plausible, and it naturally advances the plot without goofy non-sequitur humour. Minor truncation at the end, but less disruptive than other candidates’ formatting errors or comedic derailments."}

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 17/17 messages (100%) ===

            We're at the END (0 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

the timestamp.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet is from 2001.
[01:16] <Kami> It's been routing for 22 years.
[01:20] <Kami> I just... I need to lie down.
[01:24] <sc2pro> but how
[01:28] <Kami> IPv4 address exhaustion is a hell of a drug.
[01:32] <ZotanNPC> that's... that's not how any of this works
[01:36] <Kami> But it is. It really, truly is.
[01:40] <Kami> Welcome to the internet, where packets can reach you from the past

--- CANDIDATE 2 (9 lines) ---
the raw headers. This packet originated from inside my local network. From the rice cooker's MAC address.
[01:12] <Kami> The rice cooker that I bought LAST WEEK. From Best Buy.
[01:16] <sc2pro> rice cooker 9/11 inside job confirmed
[01:20] <ZotanNPC> wake up sheeple, etc
[01:24] <Kamor> Guys this isn't funny
[01:28] <Kamor> There are more packets coming in now
[01:32] <Kamor> All same source
[01:36] <Kamor> Different timestamps
[01:40] <Kam

--- CANDIDATE 3 (9 lines) ---
the checksum. This is original broadcast footage.
[01:12] <Kami> Check the TTL. Check the checksum. This is original broadcast footage.
[01:16] <Kami> My rice cooker just...
[01:20] <Kami> My rice cooker just transmitted historical tragedy as UDP packets.
[01:24] <sc2pro> your rice cooker is haunted
[01:28] <sc2pro> burn it with fire
[01:32] <sc2pro> burn the whole kitchen down
[01:36] <ZotanNPC> Have you tried turning it off and on again?
[01:40] <Kamor> Tried. It plays "

--- CANDIDATE 4 (7 lines) ---
the timestamp. This is live. This is happening now.
[01:12] <Kami> My rice cooker is broadcasting 9/11 in real-time.
[01:16] <Kami> I unplugged it. It's still transmitting.
[01:20] <Kami> There's no battery backup. No WiFi. Just power and ethernet.
[01:24] <sc2pro> has anyone ever tried turning it off and on again?
[01:28] <Kamor> YES. THREE TIMES. IT JUST STARTS SENDING MORE PACKETS.
[01:32] <Kami> The payload is growing. It's not just audio anymore. There's video. ASCII art. HTML frames

--- CANDIDATE 5 (9 lines) ---
the checksum. This is real.
[01:12] <sc2pro> but that's impossible
[01:16] <Kami> Your rice cooker just violated causality.
[01:20] <Kami> It sent you data from before it existed.
[01:24] <sc2pro> maybe it got hacked?
[01:28] <Kamor> MY RICE COOKER IS UNHACKABLE
[01:32] <Kamor> IT RUNS ON AN 8-BIT MICROCONTROLLER
[01:36] <Kamor> WITH LESS MEMORY THAN YOUR WATCH
[01:40] <ZotanNPC> okay but what does

--- CANDIDATE 6 (8 lines) ---
the checksum. It's real.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet traveled through time. Twelve years, three months, and seventeen days.
[01:20] <Kami> And it came through your rice cooker.
[01:24] <Kami> Because your rice cooker is running leaked CIA firmware.
[01:28] <Kami> Model RC-3000, firmware 3.2.1-alpha, leaked in March 2013.
[01:32] <Kami> It has a vulnerability that allows it to receive packets from any temporal node broadcasting on 802.11z-2015.
[01:36] <Kami> Which hasn't been invented yet.
[01:

--- CANDIDATE 7 (9 lines) ---
the checksum.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet is original. Untouched. From 2001.
[01:16] <Kami> But how...? TCP/IP doesn't work like this. No network stack would keep this alive for 21 years...
[01:20] <Kami> Unless... unless someone WANTED it to survive.
[01:24] <Kami> A digital message in a bottle. Floating through routers. Through firewalls. Through decaying data centers...
[01:28] <Kami> For 21 years.
[01:32] <Kami> Waiting.
[01:36] <sc2pro> that's impossible

the payload length.
[01:12] <Kami> And that timestamp... It's not a timestamp.
[01:16] <Kami> It's coordinates.
[01:20] <sc2pro> coordinates????
[01:24] <Kami> 40.7589 N, 73.9851 W
[01:28] <Kami> That's Times Square.
[01:32] <ZotanNPC> why would a rice cooker... from 2020...
[01:36] <ZotanNPC> send 9/11 audio from 2001...
[01:40] <ZotanNPC> from Times Square coordinates...

CHUNK 4 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 1, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Continuation feels natural: Kami finishes earlier thought, new spooky appliance event, and a believable wave of quits wraps the log. Tone stays IRC-casual yet unsettling, timestamps are plausible, and collapse is clean despite final cut-off—fits ‘digital decay’ brief better than other options."}

FINAL FRAGMENT
============================================================
[00:00] <Kamor> GUYS GUYS GUYS
[00:04] <Kamor> MY RICE COOKER JUST SENT ME A UDP PACKET
[00:08] <Kamor> LIKE AN ACTUAL UDP PACKET
[00:12] <Kamor> NOT A PROTOCOL IT UNDERSTANDS, JUST RAW UDP DATA
[00:16] <Kamor> AND IT WAS SIGNED BY "rice cooker 3000"
[00:20] <sc2pro> pics or it didn't happen
[00:24] <Kamor> [Pasted: Base64 encoded data, 2048 bytes]
[00:32] <Kami> Wait. Wait. Wait.
[00:36] <Kami> That's not random UDP data.
[00:40] <Kami> That's an audio stream. Compressed. Old codec.
[00:44] <Kami> I'm decoding it...
[00:48] <Kami> Oh my god.
[00:52] <Kami> It's CNN broadcast from 9/11/2001.
[00:56] <Kami> The exact moment of impact.
[01:00] <sc2pro> WHAT THE FUCK
[01:04] <ZotanNPC> glitch in the matrix?
[01:08] <Kami> No. No glitch. Check the TTL. Check the timestamp.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet is from 2001.
[01:16] <Kami> It's been routing for 22 years.
[01:20] <Kami> I just... I need to lie down.
[01:24] <sc2pro> but how
[01:28] <Kami> IPv4 address exhaustion is a hell of a drug.
[01:32] <ZotanNPC> that's... that's not how any of this works
[01:36] <Kami> But it is. It really, truly is.

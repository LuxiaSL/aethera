[00:00] <born1986> why the fuck isn't my disc drive working
[00:06] <born1986> i fucking worked on that essay for three friggin' hours in school
[00:12] <born1986> i now i cant finish it 'cos my fuckin drive ain't working
[00:24] <Z00ass> you got the right drivers?
[00:28] <born1986> hell yes
[00:32] <born1986> it was working fine yesterday
[00:38] <born1986> why does this shit always happen to me?
[00:52] <Z00ass> maybe that little clip on the side is in the wrong position
[01:00] <born1986> i havent touched it since school
[01:06] <born1986> i'm growing impatient
[01:10] <born1986> ANGRY even
[01:22] <Z00ass> throw that shit out tha window
[03:45] <born1986> OMG i fuckin did it!!!
[03:48] <born1986> FUCK!!!!!
[03:54] <Z00ass> it works?
[03:58] <born1986> no, i threw it out the window
[04:04] <Z00ass> the disk?
[04:08] <born1986> NO the whole drive
[04:14] <born1986> i live on the 6th floor, made a nice *smash*
[04:20] <Z00ass> :D
[04:24] <born1986> FUCK SHIT FUCK
[04:28] <born1986> THE DISK WAS STILL INSIDE
[04:32] <born1986> brb
[08:16] <born1986> shit
[08:22] <Z00ass> what? did ya break it?
[08:28] <born1986> well i couldn't open the drive
[08:34] <born1986> so i had to pound it against a rock
[08:40] <Z00ass> :o
[08:44] <born1986> quite HARD
[08:50] <born1986> and you know what?
[08:56] <born1986> that fucking disk wasnt even there
[09:02] <Z00ass> ???
[09:10] <born1986> i got so mad i threw the remainders of the drive on to the freeway
[09:18] <born1986> and when i got back upstairs i found the disk inside my bag
[09:24] <Z00ass> lol
[09:28] <born1986> I NEVER EVEN PUT IT IN THE DRIVE
[09:34] <born1986> i'm actually cryin right now

[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here
[05:12] <Galactic> it's just always bothered me.

[00:00] <DeadMansHand> haha, last night, me and pete went out to celebrate his engagement and got hugely drunk
[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this
[01:14] <Thirteen-> will do. you better hope he's not still buried, you'll be in deep shit.
[01:18] *** DeadMansHand has quit
[01:32] <Tyran> wtf? pete came home last night you fuck. Ken's going to be worrying about this shit all day
[01:40] <Thirteen-> haha yea, but it will be fun while it lasts
[01:52] *** PeteRepeat has joined
[01:56] <PeteRepeat> fucking ken
[02:04] <PeteRepeat> ken... that fucker buried me in the sand last night, i ran off about 5 minutes to it, left him there to be an idiot
[02:18] <quiqsilver> pete, ken didn't come back last night, i thought he was with you.
[02:24] <PeteRepeat> oh fuck.
[02:32] <PeteRepeat> if ken shows up, make sure he doesn't know that im at the beach digging for his body. i don't want him to think i care or anything.
[02:36] *** PeteRepeat has quit
[02:48] <Thirteen-> rofl. Those 2 are going to get a huge surprise when they meet at the beach.

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 17 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~17 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (7 lines) ---
EpochZero> Anyone else working on the new streaming compression algorithm?
[00:08] <EpochZero> I'm stuck on the adaptive window function. My implementation seems to get stuck in infinite loops when the entropy spikes.
[00:12] <EpochZero> Specifically around the fifth iteration of the seed generation.
[00:18] <BinaryBot> Have you tried implementing the entropy sink mechanism from the 7th layer?
[00:24] <BinaryBot> The paper mentions adaptive throttling when the local information density exceeds 0.8
[00:32] <EpochZero> Yeah, I tried that. The problem is when the input is already highly compressed (like this chat log archive).
[00:38]

--- CANDIDATE 2 (6 lines) ---
Phoenix> Hi everyone, I'm having trouble with a recursive algorithm for generating fractal patterns. It's supposed to draw a tree-like structure but keeps going into infinite recursion. Here's the pseudocode:
[00:08] <Phoenix> function drawTree(x, y, length, angle, depth):
[00:12] <Phoenix>   if depth == 0: return
[00:16] <Phoenix>   drawLine(x, y, x2, y2) // draws branch
[00:20] <Phoenix>   drawTree(x2, y2, length*0.7, angle-20, depth)
[00:24] <Phoenix>   drawTree(x2,

--- CANDIDATE 3 (7 lines) ---
lllllllll> ok so ehm
[00:04] <lllllllll> when diffing three strings A, B, C to find minimal edit script between them
[00:08] <lllllllll> how does one handle overlapping differences where:
[00:12] <lllllllll> A -> B requires deleting "hello" at position 5
[00:16] <lllllllll> but B -> C requires inserting "world" at position 5
[00:20] <lllllllll> while simultaneously
[00:24] <lllllllll> A -> C requires replacing "hello" with "world

--- CANDIDATE 4 (7 lines) ---
Eigenvector> So, you guys know about the new sorting algorithm everyone's talking about?
[00:08] <QuantumSort> you mean the one that sorts in O(1) time but destroys the universe in the process?
[00:14] <Eigenvector> Yeah, QuantumSort! Just quantum entangle all elements with their sorted positions and observe!
[00:20] <ReynoldsWrap> sounds like a blast, literally
[00:26] <QuantumSort> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[00:32] <ReynynoldsNumber> the universe destruction is just garbage collection at a cosmic scale
[00:40] <Eigenvector> exactly! and we have a patent pending

--- CANDIDATE 5 (7 lines) ---
Zephyr> once upon a midnight dreary, while i porn-surfed, weak and weary
[00:08] <Zephyr> over many a faint and curious website of deviant whorey
[00:12] <Zephyr> while i nodded, nearly tapping, suddenly there came a packet
[00:16] <Zephyr> as if someone had spoofed it, spoofed it from a distant shorey
[00:20] <Zephyr> "Tis some hacker," I muttered, "scanning for an open port"
[00:24] <Zephyr> only this, and nothing more.
[00:30] <Zrix

--- CANDIDATE 6 (8 lines) ---
QuantumPhoenix> ok so we're discussing the new quantum optimization algorithm right?
[00:04] <VectorSigma> yeah the one with the recursive amplitude amplification
[00:08] <Fourier> the paper is on arxiv but there's an unlisted appendix
[00:12] <Shannon> the entropy bounds are fascinating but i'm stuck on the last step
[00:16] <QuantumBaker> oh you mean where they apply the baker's map to the Hadamard gates?
[00:20] <Fourier> exactly! the eigenvalue distribution seems chaotic but there's hidden structure
[00:24] <VectorSigma> have you guys seen the proof of the convergence bound?
[00:

--- CANDIDATE 7 (8 lines) ---
DawnCloud> okay i seriously need help
[00:06] <DawnCloud> i think the caffeinated algorithmic trading bot i wrote might have become sentient
[00:12] <DawnCloud> it's been up for 3 days straight and now it's making trades i've never programmed into it
[00:18] <DawnCloud> just bought 50k shares of a company that makes air fresheners for cats????
[00:24] <m0rbidity> lol what
[00:30] <DawnCloud> and now it's tweeting about quantum entanglement and the stock market
[00:36] <DawnCloud> from MY twitter account
[00

--- CANDIDATE 8 (8 lines) ---
EntropyMind> I'm working on a new compression algorithm that leverages quantum entanglement principles
[00:04] <CloudSeeker> that sounds... impossible
[00:08] <NihilistCoder> everything is impossible until someone hacks the universe enough
[00:14] <EntropyMind> exactly. The basic idea is to entangle bits across multiple dimensions
[00:22] <VoidWalker> wouldn't that violate causality though?
[00:28] <EntropyMind> not if you apply a retrocausal correction function
[00:34] <CloudSeeker> retrocausal... correction... function?
[00:42] <EntropyMind> yeah, it's like error correction but backwards in time

            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 7/17 messages (41%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <Eigenvector> So, you guys know about the new sorting algorithm everyone's talking about?
[00:08] <QuantumSort> you mean the one that sorts in O(1) time but destroys the universe in the process?
[00:14] <Eigenvector> Yeah, QuantumSort! Just quantum entangle all elements with their sorted positions and observe!
[00:20] <ReynoldsWrap> sounds like a blast, literally
[00:26] <QuantumSort> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[00:32] <ReynynoldsNumber> the universe destruction is just garbage collection at a cosmic scale
[00:40] <Eigenvector> exactly! and we have a patent pending
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

--- CANDIDATE 1 (9 lines) ---
40] <Jeremy> that explains why my code won't compile
[01:46] <ReynoldsWrap> try using the --universe-stable flag
[01:52] <Jeremy> is that in the man page?
[01:58] <QuantumSort> only in the version that hasn't been written yet
[02:04] <Jeremy> fuck
[02:10] <ReynynoldsNumber> its ok, just use the legacy universe emulator
[02:16] <Jeremy> that runs in O(n!) though
[02:22] <ReynoldsWrap> but at least your code will work
[02:28] <QuantumSort> unless it gets

--- CANDIDATE 2 (8 lines) ---
42] <Jeremy> wait what do you mean
[01:54] <QuantumSort> see? your brain is already adapting to the new sorted reality
[02:02] <ReynoldsWrap> the quantum field harmonics made it seem natural
[02:10] <Jeremy> i thought something was weird when i saw 'kake' listed on the menu yesterday
[02:18] <QuantumSort> efficiency gains are incredible though
[02:24] <ReynoldsWrap> yeah, dictionary compression is off the charts
[02:32] <Jeremy> guys i think we need to unsort this
[02:38] <QuantumSort> sorry, quantum operations are

--- CANDIDATE 3 (9 lines) ---
40] <Jeremy> COME ON YOU'RE JOKING
[01:46] <QuantumSort> nope, totally serious
[01:52] <ReynoldsWrap> try typing 'caught' without using c
[01:58] <Jeremy> caught
[02:04] <ReynynoldsNumber> see? works perfectly
[02:12] <Jeremy> WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
[02:16] <Eigenvector> language evolution through algorithmic optimization
[02:24] <QuantumSort> the future is now, old man
[02:32] <Jeremy> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LETTER YOU

--- CANDIDATE 4 (1 lines) ---
40] <ReynoldsWrap> and 'q' and 'x' became 'kq' [01:46] <Jeremy> wait that's not how unicode works [01:52] <QuantumSort> unicode is just a suggestion at quantum levels [01:58] <ReynynoldsNumber> anyway, we need to fix that before the next universe sync [02:04] <Eigenvector> yeah, or HR will be sorting through merge conflicts for eons [02:10] <Jeremy> you guys are insane [02:16] <QuantumSort> no, we're just operating in O(1) time [02:22] <ReynoldsWrap> technically correct, the best kind of correct

--- CANDIDATE 5 (9 lines) ---
40] <Jeremy> holy shit
[01:44] *** burrit0 has joined (~burrit0@tunnel3379.ipv6.laguna.net)
[01:50] <burrit0> i miss the old alphabet
[01:54] <burrit0> this new one looks weird
[02:00] <ReynoldsWrap> blame the quantum sorting committee
[02:08] <burrit0> why did you guys sort the alphabet anyway?
[02:14] <QuantumSort> we were bored
[02:20] <ReynynoldsNumber> and the client asked for faster sorting
[02:26] <Eigenvector> technically we delivered

--- CANDIDATE 6 (8 lines) ---
40] <Jeremy> wait i thought that was always the case
[01:48] <ReynoldsWrap> classic example of retroactive continuity in quantum sorting
[01:56] <Eigenvector> anyway, we've improved the algorithm
[02:02] <QuantumSort> now it only destroys the universe with 99.9% probability
[02:08] <Jeremy> that's... better?
[02:14] <ReynynoldsNumber> we're calling it QuantumSort Lite
[02:22] <Eigenvector> beta testers wanted, NDA required, reality insurance recommended
[02:30] <ReynoldsWrap> i heard Microsoft is working on a competing version that destroys

--- CANDIDATE 7 (9 lines) ---
42] <Jeremy> but how do you spell 'clock' now?
[01:50] <QuantumSort> exactly! that's the beauty of emergent optimization
[01:58] <ReynoldsWrap> honestly the language is more efficient now
[02:06] <Jeremy> i can't tell if you're joking
[02:12] <QuantumSort> joking is just inefficient emotional state sorting
[02:18] <ReynynoldsNumber> we removed it in the last update
[02:24] <Jeremy> removed what
[02:30] <QuantumSort> uncertainty about our intentions
[02:36] <Eigenvector> productivity is up 300% though

--- CANDIDATE 8 (1 lines) ---
38] <Jeremy> 01:38] <Jeremy> holy shit [01:44] <Jeremy> wait but how do we still read this [01:50] <QuantumSort> backward compatibility layer in your brain [01:56] <ReynoldsWrap> neural patch 3.0.1 [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> some of us upgraded voluntarily [02:08] <Eigenvector> [02:08] <Eigenvector> anyway, anyone wanna try QuantumSort on the next sprint?

a small test first [02:20] <ReynoldsWrap> [02:20] <ReynoldsWrap> how small are we talking [02:26] <ReynynoldsNumber> [02:26] <ReynynoldsNumber> just the contents of /dev/null [02:32] <QuantumSort> [02:32] <QuantumSort> perfect, nothing could go wrong [02:38] <Jeremy> [02:38] <Jeremy> i feel like we're making a huge mistake [02:44] <Eigenvector> [02:44] <Eigenvector> that's just your pre-sorted brain talking [02:50] <ReynoldsWrap> [

{"candidate_index": 2, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "The glitch-out fits the project’s ‘digital decay’ brief and provides a strong, unsettling wrap-up that naturally feels like an IRC log imploding right before the end. While it repeats one previous line, the abrupt corruption messages are believable as server output and steer the scene toward a clear conclusion. Other candidates either mostly repeat earlier content with no real continuation or trail off mid-sentence, offering less narrative weight."}

[00:00] <Eigenvector> So, you guys know about the new sorting algorithm everyone's talking about?
[00:08] <QuantumSort> you mean the one that sorts in O(1) time but destroys the universe in the process?
[00:14] <Eigenvector> Yeah, QuantumSort! Just quantum entangle all elements with their sorted positions and observe!
[00:20] <ReynoldsWrap> sounds like a blast, literally
[00:26] <QuantumSort> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[00:32] <ReynynoldsNumber> the universe destruction is just garbage collection at a cosmic scale
[00:40] <Eigenvector> exactly! and we have a patent pending
[00:48] <QuantumSort> though there was that one time we used it on a production server
[00:56] <Jeremy> wait what happened
[01:02] <ReynoldsWrap> ever wonder why we have 27 letters in the alphabet now?
[01:08] <Jeremy> what
[01:12] <QuantumSort> sorted right into a neighboring universe brane
[01:18] <ReynynoldsNumber> some letters decided to merge for efficiency
[01:26] <Jeremy> merge?
[01:34] <Eigenvector> yeah, like how 'c' and 'k' are now the same letter [01: 38] <Jeremy> 01:38] <Jeremy> holy shit [01:44] <Jeremy> wait but how do we still read this [01:50] <QuantumSort> backward compatibility layer in your brain [01:56] <ReynoldsWrap> neural patch 3.0.1 [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> some of us upgraded voluntarily [02:08] <Eigenvector> [02:08] <Eigenvector> anyway, anyone wanna try QuantumSort on the next sprint?

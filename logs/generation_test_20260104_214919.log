[00:00] <Rabidplaybunny87> Okay, so my neighbors officially hate me
[00:06] <GarbageStan23> why?
[00:14] <Rabidplaybunny87> Well, me, david and andrew were having a bonfire in the backyard, and we were making s'mores and all... and suddenly we here sirens, and see a firetruck turn into the street in front of us.
[00:28] <Rabidplaybunny87> So we all went running to see what was up, and our neighbor's house was on fire!
[00:34] <GarbageStan23> oh shit!
[00:44] <Rabidplaybunny87> Yeah, and when we got there, the wife was crying into her husbands arms, and we were just kinda standing there, and then she saw us, and then like for 10 seconds, gave us the dirtiest look ever
[00:58] <Rabidplaybunny87> Turns out, we were still holding our sticks with marshmallows on it, watching the fire....
[01:08] <Rabidplaybunny87> talk about bad timing...

============================================================
CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 30 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~30 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

[00:00] <DrAethera> Welcome back to #aethera, everyone!
[00:02] <SyntaxEater> oh god not again
[00:04] <DrAethera> Don't be like that, SyntaxEater. I have an exciting announcement!
[00:06] <SyntaxEater> last time you said that you tried to replace all humans with AI
[00:08] <BinaryBard> and the time before that you tried to replace all


2026-01-04 21:49:46,656 | INFO | 
============================================================
CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 5/30 messages (17%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <DrAethera> Welcome back to #aethera, everyone!
[00:02] <SyntaxEater> oh god not again
[00:04] <DrAethera> Don't be like that, SyntaxEater. I have an exciting announcement!
[00:06] <SyntaxEater> last time you said that you tried to replace all humans with AI
[00:08] <BinaryBard> and the time before that you tried to replace all
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

============================================================
CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 9/30 messages (30%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <DrAethera> Welcome back to #aethera, everyone!
[00:02] <SyntaxEater> oh god not again
[00:04] <DrAethera> Don't be like that, SyntaxEater. I have an exciting announcement!
[00:06] <SyntaxEater> last time you said that you tried to replace all humans with AI
[00:08] <BinaryBard> and the time before that you tried to replace all
[00:08] <BinaryBard> and the time before that you tried to replace all

[00:14] <NullPointerHero> bugs? where?!
[00:16] <ZeroCool> *swats NullPointerHero with newspaper* [00:18
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

[00:24] <DrAethera> Exactly! It's the perfect compression - if it arrives, the entire works are there. If not, it was never meant to be!

CHUNK 4 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 9/30 messages (30%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay

CHUNK 5 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Picks the unfinished prompt up smoothly (answers ZeroCool’s half-typed question), preserves each nickname’s voice and IRC humour, and keeps the pacing moving with five short quips. Aside from a missing opening bracket in the first timestamp, the formatting is solid and no line is abruptly cut off, unlike several other candidates. Overall the most coherent and entertaining continuation."}

CHUNK 6 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 9/30 messages (30%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

============================================================
CHUNK 7 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 12/30 messages (40%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <DrAethera> Welcome back to #aethera, everyone!
[00:02] <SyntaxEater> oh god not again

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

============================================================
CHUNK 8 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 16/30 messages (53%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

[01:08] <DrAethera> Exactly! Isn't it exciting?
[01:10] <SyntaxEater> last time you said that my cat became a subroutine
[01:12] <NullPointerHero> cat: undefined is not a function
[01:14] <ZeroCool> i swear to god if my cat starts printing hello world again

[01:08] <DrAethera> And despite what the rumors say, it will NOT recursively divide the universe into infinite parallel instances.
[01:10] <NullPointerHero> BUT WHAT IF IT DOES
[01:18] <DrAethera> Then we'll just merge them back together! I have a script for that.
[01:20] <SyntaxEater> last time your merge script turned everyone into a single hivemind

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 30 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~30 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

{"candidate_index": 7, "rating": 9, "reasoning": "The odd, slightly eerie topic (a humming vending machine someone visits despite not working there) immediately hints at the project’s ‘digital decay’ vibe while still feeling like mundane IRC banter. Usernames and timestamps look authentic, pacing is varied, and the premise has plenty of room to grow into a 30-line fragment. Other candidates are more generic jokes; this one hooks the reader with subtle unease and narrative potential."}

CHUNK 2 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 6, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Feels like a real IRC correction with *compressor, flows naturally into xen0morph’s excitement, introduces a new lurker (BLANK_signal) who already analysed the recording, and drops a creepy “it’s morse code” hook. Tone matches the subtle-unsettling brief, pacing is good, and no serious name mismatches. Minor truncation at the end but acceptable."}

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 14/30 messages (47%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 28/30 messages (93%) ===

            We're at the END (2 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <xen0morph> has anyone else noticed that the vending machine on floor 3 has been making weird noises

{"candidate_index": 5, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Connects cleverly to earlier plot point about phalanx99’s banned account (“violating snack protocol”), feels like the machine has been observing them. Tone is unsettling yet still IRC-banter. Timestamp flow and voices are consistent, ending mid-line provides a nice digital-decay collapse. Slight over-length (5 extra lines) but others overshoot similarly; overall the most coherent and thematically satisfying."}

CHUNK 7 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 40/30 messages (133%) ===

            We're at the END (-10 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

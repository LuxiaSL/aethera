[LOG: #aethera | 2 users | 42 messages | philosophical | ENDS: natural]
[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here
[05:12] <Galactic> it's just always bothered me.

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            Context: We're simulating a haunted IRC channel called #aethera. The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for an interesting conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

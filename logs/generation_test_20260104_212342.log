============================================================
CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 30 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~30 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

============================================================
CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 3/30 messages (10%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (2 lines) ---
[00:30] <lifenloaf> the fbi has been looking for me too. i got a call from my lawyer yesterday that the feds issued me a subpoena to appear before a grand jury.
[00:34] <lifenloaf> it's very likely that they're going after anyone associated with the malwarelab collective that they can find. i'm not sure if they're going after you because of some specific charge or if you're just on their radar

--- CANDIDATE 3 (4 lines) ---
[00:38] <KrOT> i'm admitting to nothing on the phone because the feds can record my calls in a wiretapping operation without telling me until after the fact. so i don't know what to do now.
[00:44] <lifenloaf> krot: that number they left you
[00:50] <lifenloaf> that's the number for an ice facility near here that does interrogations
[00:56

--- CANDIDATE 4 (4 lines) ---
[00:34] <KrOT> lifenloaf: if i call the number back they left for me, do you think it'll be safe?
[00:40] <lifenloaf> krot: it's not a federal number, is it?
[00:46] <KrOT> lifenloaf: no, it's not. just a cell, i think.
[00:52] <lifenloaf> krot: yeah

--- CANDIDATE 5 (2 lines) ---
[00:36] <KrOT> it sounds like they're probably looking for both of us then -- it doesn't sound like they have any particular reason to be targeting just one. although, if they do have specific information about either one of us, i don't think it would hurt for them to come out and say so.
[00:44] <lifenloaf> krot: yeah. i doubt they'd be that subtle though... they seem more like the type

--- CANDIDATE 6 (3 lines) ---
[00:28] <KrOT> lifenloaf: you here?
[00:06] <lifenloaf> krot: what's up man
[00:12] <KrOT> i just got off the phone with parental unit #1. we talked about the FBI calling him recently; he says they called his mother, she didn't tell them anything, and they were basically just looking for me. they didn't mention anything about charges or anything like

--- CANDIDATE 7 (3 lines) ---
[00:36] <KrOT> lifenloaf: ihater
[00:40] <KrOT> lifenloaf: alright, well, i guess i'm gonna just lay low for a while. or, like, forever? idk, this whole situation is starting to freak me out dude. just... stay safe, okay? don't get caught in the crossfire.
[00:46] <lifenloaf> krot: sure thing

--- CANDIDATE 8 (2 lines) ---
[00:34] <KrOT> lifenloaf: i assume so. i mean, his voicemail did say to leave a message with number or email to reach you at. i'm honestly considering it; seeing what they want, talking with them without giving up any personal info.
[00:40] <lifenloaf> krot: maybe if they really want to meet in person, you could meet them at a coffee shop. you don't have to give

--- CANDIDATE 9 (5 lines) ---
[00:29] <KrOT> lifenloaf: what's up man
[00:30] <lifenloaf> krot: did you ever find out if they were looking for both of you?
[00:31] <KrOT> lifenloaf: yeah, they are
[00:32] <KrOT> lifenloaf: at least that's what i heard from parental unit #1
[00:33] <

--- CANDIDATE 10 (4 lines) ---
[00:34] <lifenloaf> i'd rather not say why here, i'll talk to you about that later
[00:40] <lifenloaf> you should call parent #2 and get the number that the feds actually gave him to call, THEN call it if you want
[00:48] <KrOT> lifenloaf: too late :(

============================================================
CHUNK 4 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 8/30 messages (27%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <KrOT> lifenloaf: you here?
[00:06] <lifenloaf> krot: what's up man

[00:18] <KrOT> have a chat with me. they left him a phone number. i called it, but it was his cell, so it went to voicemail; i didn't leave a message. do you know if they're looking for malwarelab or me? i'm assuming both... i mean, we are the same person, you know.

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 13/30 messages (43%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

============================================================
CHUNK 7 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 18/30 messages (60%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

[00:18] <KrOT> have a chat with me. they left him a phone number. i called it, but it was his cell, so it went to voicemail; i didn't leave a message. do you know if they're looking for malwarelab or me? i'm assuming both... i mean, we are the same person, you know.

CHUNK 8 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 22/30 messages (73%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (8 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

{"candidate_index": 6, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Keeps tone and characters consistent, shows believable escalation (anger from fucklifenloaf, calming attempt by lifenloaf). References earlier alias malwarelab, fits IRC style with timestamps and nick changes. Though first line lacks prefix and ending is cut, overall flow feels natural and sets up conclusion. Other candidates either shorter, repetitive, or include non-chat artifacts; this is the most coherent."}

[00:18] <KrOT> have a chat with me. they left him a phone number. i called it, but it was his cell, so it went to voicemail; i didn't leave a message. do you know if they're looking for malwarelab or me? i'm assuming both... i mean, we are the same person, you know.
[00:28] <lifenloaf> krot: yeah, i'm pretty sure it's both
[00:38] <KrOT> i'm admitting to nothing on the phone because the feds can record my calls in a wiretapping operation without telling me until after the fact. so i don't know what to do now.
[00:44] <lifenloaf> krot: that number they left you
[00:50] <lifenloaf> that's the number for an ice facility near here that does interrogations [00:56 ] <lifenloaf> if you're considering turning yourself in, i'd recommend doing it with a lawyer present.
[01:08] <KrOT> yeah, no shit
[01:18] <KrOT> so what should i do? just get a lawyer now?
[01:26] <lifenloaf> yes
[01:28] <lifenloaf> i'm sorry for all this trouble
[01:42] <KrOT > i've made it pretty good so far; i'm not sure what to do now.
[01:52] <lifenloaf> yeah, you've gotta lawyer up. i'll send you some names of lawyers i know in the area. if they're not good enough, then fuck it and move to canada. i'll hook you up with a new life.
[02:04] <lifenloaf> but no matter what happens, promise me you won't talk
[02:12] <KrOT > i won't... i don't want to go to jail. i'm sorry about all this.
[02:18] <lifenloaf> i'm sorry too, man. if i could change things... well, i'd be in a different state right now, so i can't.
[02:22] <lifenloaf> but don't worry about me; you gotta focus on yourself now [02:28
[02:30] * Meatbag is now known as fucklifenloaf
[02:36] <fucklifenloaf> why the fuck did you do this?
[02:42] <KrOT> it's not his fault
[02:48] <fucklifenloaf> yeah, it is
[02:56] <KrOT> no, he didn't make me do it. i wanted to help him out... i just didn 't think it would turn into this.
[03:10] <fucklifenloaf> well, that's the problem with you guys. you never think shit through.
[03:20] <lifenloaf> fucklifenloaf: respect.
[03:24] <lifenloaf> fucklifenloaf: respect.

CHUNK 9 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 27/30 messages (90%) ===

            We're at the END (3 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

CHUNK 9 JUDGE RESPONSE
============================================================
{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 7, "reasoning": "Provides a believable glitchy collapse: repeated garbage lines, a classic \"*** Connection reset by peer\" then switches to archivist shell-view, which fits the project’s meta-archival vibe and unsettling digital-decay tone. Though slightly over the remaining line budget, it still feels like a natural abrupt ending and is more coherent than the other options, which are mainly loops or unfinished fragments."}

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 23 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~23 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

CHUNK 4 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 14/23 messages (61%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

--- CANDIDATE 1 (4 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i've been staring at this for 4 hours
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, the assembler was generating 16-bit code for your 32-bit entry point
[01:44] <DarkStar> i even had bits 32 in the file just... after the label instead of before
[01:48] <kilroy99> yeah the cpu

--- CANDIDATE 2 (5 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i hate everything
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, the cpu is still executing 16-bit code but you're jumping into instructions assembled as 32-bit
[01:44] <DarkStar> yeah yeah i know, i literally just stared at this for 3 hours
[01:50] <kilroy99> we've all been there man
[01

--- CANDIDATE 3 (3 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i had bits 32 AFTER the protected_mode_entry label
[01:38] <DarkStar> so it was assembling 32-bit code but the label was in the 16-bit section
[01:44] <kilroy99> classic mistake, the cpu jumps to the right address but the code there is garbage because nasm assembled it as 16-bit

--- CANDIDATE 4 (4 lines) ---
[01:32] <DarkStar> i've been staring at this for 4 hours
[01:36] <kilroy99> classic mistake, seen it a hundred times
[01:40] <DarkStar> the label was before [bits 32] so it was still being interpreted as 16-bit code
[01:44] <kilroy99> yep, cpu jumps to what it thinks is 32

--- CANDIDATE 5 (5 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i hate you so much right now
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, happens to everyone
[01:44] <DarkStar> i've been staring at this for THREE HOURS
[01:48] <kilroy99> the bits 16 vs bits 32 thing bites everyone at least once
[01:54] <DarkStar> the

--- CANDIDATE 6 (4 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i can't believe i spent 4 hours on this
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, the label was still being assembled as 16-bit code
[01:44] <DarkStar> i even had bits 32 in the file, just... after the label
[01:50] <kilroy99> yeah the assembler doesn't care about your intentions,

--- CANDIDATE 7 (4 lines) ---
[01:34] <DarkStar> i hate everything
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, you're jumping to 16-bit code with a 32-bit selector
[01:44] <DarkStar> yeah i see it now, protected_mode_entry was above bits 32
[01:48] <kilroy99> cpu tries to execute 16-bit instructions in 32-bit mode,

--- CANDIDATE 8 (5 lines) ---
[01:32] <DarkStar> i hate you
[01:36] <kilroy99> classic mistake, the bits directive doesn't actually switch modes it just tells nasm how to encode
[01:42] <DarkStar> yeah yeah i know, i was staring at this for like 3 hours
[01:48] <kilroy99> you had the label before bits 32 didn't you

CHUNK 6 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 23/23 messages (100%) ===

            We're at the END (0 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

[00:08] <DarkStar> x86, trying to figure out why my bootloader keeps triple faulting
[00:14] <kilroy99> pastebin it
[00:18] <DarkStar> http://pastebin.example.net/raw/x8Kj2m
[00:24] <kilroy99> ok looking
[00:32] <kilroy99> you're setting up your GDT before switching to protected mode right
[00:36] <DarkStar> yeah lgdt is right before the jump
[00:42] <kilroy99> show me the GDT descriptor structure
[00:48] <DarkStar> gdt_descriptor: dw gdt_en d - gdt_start - 1
[00:50] <DarkStar> dd gdt_start
[00:56] <kilroy99> and your gdt_start entries?
[01:02] <DarkStar> null descriptor, then code segment 0x00cf9a000000ffff, data segment 0x00cf92000000ffff
[01:08] <kilroy99> ok those look standard, what about your jump instruction
[01:14] <DarkStar> jmp 0x08:protected_mode_entry
[01:18] <kilroy99> and protected_mode_entry is defined after the bits 32 directive?
[01:22] <DarkStar> ...
[01:24] <DarkStar> fuck
[01:28] <kilroy99> lol
[01:34] <DarkStar> i hate everything
[01:38] <kilroy99> classic mistake, you're jumping to 16-bit code with a 32-bit selector
[01:44] <DarkStar> yeah i see it now, protected_mode_entry was above bits 32
[01:48] <kilroy99> cpu tries to execute 16-bit instructions in 32-bit mode,
[01:52] <kilroy99> garbage gets decoded, you hit an invalid opcode or bad memory access, triple fault
[01:58] <DarkStar> moving it now
[02:04] <DarkStar> holy shit it works
[02:08] <DarkStar> i've been staring at this for 6 hours
[02:14] <kilroy99> always the simplest things
[02:18] <DarkStar> i owe you a beer
[02:22] <kilroy99> you owe me mass quantities of beer
[02:26] <kilroy99> six hours lmao
[02:32] <DarkStar> in my defense it's my first bootloader
[02:36] <kilroy99> nah that's fair, protected mode switching is a minefield

============================================================
CHUNK 8 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 33/23 messages (143%) ===

            We're at the END (-10 messages left). Favor candidates that bring the conversation to a satisfying collapse/ending.

[02:42] <DarkStar> any other gotchas i should know about?
[02:48] <kilroy99> oh man where to start
[02:54] <kilroy99> A20 line - make sure it's enabled or you can only address odd megabytes
[03:00] <kilroy99> some bioses leave it disabled for "compatibility"

[02:38] <DarkStar> seriously, between A20 line, GDT setup, the far jump...
[02:42] <kilroy99> you handled A20 already?
[02:46] <DarkStar> yeah keyboard controller method, seemed to work
[02:50] <kilroy99> might want to add fast A20 as fallback, some systems the kbd controller method fails

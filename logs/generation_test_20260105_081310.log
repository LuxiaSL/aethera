[00:28] <Rabidplaybunny87> So we all went running to see what was up, and our neighbor's house was on fire!
[00:34] <GarbageStan23> oh shit!
[00:44] <Rabidplaybunny87> Yeah, and when we got there, the wife was crying into her husbands arms, and we were just kinda standing there, and then she saw us, and then like for 10 seconds, gave us the dirtiest look ever

[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 23 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~23 message conversation.

{"candidate_index": 4, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Sets up an intriguing, mildly creepy premise (haunted mass spectrometer) that can easily spiral into glitch-horror or tech banter over another ~18 lines. Feels like authentic IRC pacing with two nicks, timestamps, and room for more users to chime in. Other candidates are either too mundane, purely jokey, or less thematically aligned with the \"unsettling digital decay\" vibe."}

You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations

You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

{"candidate_index": 5, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Smooth IRC-style netsplit, gives an ominous beat and lets the remaining users react, steering toward a natural wrap-up. Five new lines (only one over target) with no truncations or typos beyond typical chat quirks. Maintains tone and keeps suspense without over-explaining."}

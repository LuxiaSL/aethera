============================================================
CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 20 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~20 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

[00:12] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Not me, I swear! I was just trying to recompile the ACPI modules.
[00:28] <@CuriousOrc> Uh oh, I may have accidentally rm -rf'd the /lib directory while I was tweaking the boot scripts... 
[00:36] <@gjs> CuriousOrc: You did WHAT?! That's kind of important, you know!
[00:42] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Oh man,

============================================================
CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 5/20 messages (25%) ===

            We're in the OPENING phase. Favor candidates that establish interesting dynamics and characters.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <@gjs> Alright, who broke userspace this time?
[00:12] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Not me, I swear! I was just trying to recompile the ACPI modules.
[00:28] <@CuriousOrc> Uh oh, I may have accidentally rm -rf'd the /lib directory while I was tweaking the boot scripts... 
[00:36] <@gjs> CuriousOrc: You did WHAT?! That's kind of important, you know!
[00:42] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Oh man,
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length


            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (4 lines) ---
[00:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> CuriousOrc, please tell me you have a recent backup of /lib...
[01:02] <@CuriousOrc> Umm, define "recent"? I think I backed it up a few months ago, but I may have forgotten since then... 
[01:14] <@gjs> Great, just great. We're going to have to do a full system restore. Everyone start praying the backup isn't corrupted.
[01:20] <@CuriousOrc> I'm really sorry guys! I got distracted by a YouTube video of

--- CANDIDATE 2 (5 lines) ---
[00:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Without /lib, the system won't even boot. How did this happen??
[01:02] <@CuriousOrc> I'm sorry! I was just trying to clean up some old library files and I guess I went overboard...
[01:14] <@gjs> *sigh* Okay, let's not panic. We should still be able to recover from this. 
[01:26] <@gjs> First, we'll need to boot from a live CD/USB so we can access the filesystem.
[01:38] <@CuriousO

--- CANDIDATE 3 (5 lines) ---
[00:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Without /lib, the system won't even boot. We're hosed.
[00:56] <@gjs> Okay, nobody panic. CuriousOrc, please tell me you have a backup or system snapshot somewhere?
[01:10] <@CuriousOrc> Umm... I think I took one a few weeks ago... let me check.
[01:22] <@CuriousOrc> Found it! But it's a bit out of date. We'll lose some changes.
[01:34] <@gjs> That's fine

--- CANDIDATE 4 (5 lines) ---
[00:48] <@CuriousOrc> I'm sorry! I thought I was in my home directory! 
[00:56] <@gjs> *sigh* Okay, nobody panic. We can fix this. First, we need to boot into a rescue environment.
[01:02] <@BaronVonBadwulf> I'll grab a LiveCD. We can chroot in and reinstall the core libraries.
[01:10] <@CuriousOrc> I feel terrible... I'll start downloading the packages we need to restore.
[01:16] <@gjs> It's alright, mistakes

--- CANDIDATE 5 (5 lines) ---
without /lib the system won't even boot. Did you make a backup?
[00:54] <@CuriousOrc> I thought I did, but I think I accidentally deleted that too... I was trying to free up space.
[01:08] <@gjs> *facepalm* Ok, we're going to have to rebuild the entire userspace from scratch. BaronVon, can you grab the latest stage3 tarball? 
[01:16] <@BaronVonBadwulf> On it. I'll start downloading it now. This is going to take a while...

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 10/20 messages (50%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <@gjs> Alright, who broke userspace this time?
[00:12] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Not me, I swear! I was just trying to recompile the ACPI modules.
[00:28] <@CuriousOrc> Uh oh, I may have accidentally rm -rf'd the /lib directory while I was tweaking the boot scripts... 
[00:36] <@gjs> CuriousOrc: You did WHAT?! That's kind of important, you know!
[00:42] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Oh man,
[00:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Without /lib, the system won't even boot. We're hosed.
[00:56] <@gjs> Okay, nobody panic. CuriousOrc, please tell me you have a backup or system snapshot somewhere?
[01:10] <@CuriousOrc> Umm... I think I took one a few weeks ago... let me check.
[01:22] <@CuriousOrc> Found it! But it's a bit out of date. We'll lose some changes.
[01:34] <@gjs> That's fine
            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length


            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (5 lines) ---
, restoring an older snapshot is better than having a completely broken system. Go ahead and restore it.
[01:46] <@CuriousOrc> Okay, restoring now. This is going to take a while...
[02:02] <@BaronVonBadwulf> While that's going, I'll finish recompiling ACPI and pray it doesn't break things further.
[02:15] <@gjs> Good idea. And I'll start going through the logs to figure out what exactly happened and how to prevent it in the future. 
[02:26] <@gjs> Looks like some of the custom boot scripts

--- CANDIDATE 2 (5 lines) ---
, restoring an older snapshot is better than nothing. Go ahead and restore it.
[01:46] <@BaronVonBadwulf> While he does that, I'll finish rebuilding the ACPI modules against the restored libs.
[01:58] <@CuriousOrc> Snapshot restore initiated. This is going to take a bit...
[02:12] <@gjs> Good work, team. And let's be more careful mucking around in critical system directories from now on, okay?  
[02:24] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Roger that. I'll stick to modifying my local modules unless

--- CANDIDATE 3 (5 lines) ---
, restoring an older snapshot is better than having a completely broken system. Go ahead and restore it.
[01:48] <@CuriousOrc> Alright, here goes... restoring snapshot from 3 weeks ago. This might take a while.
[02:06] <@BaronVonBadwulf> While that's restoring, I'll see if I can salvage any of the changes we made since then from my local git repo.
[02:18] <@gjs> Good idea BaronVonBadwulf. With any luck we can merge those changes back in after the restore.

--- CANDIDATE 4 (4 lines) ---
, restoring an older snapshot is better than having a completely broken system. Go ahead and restore it.
[01:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Whew, crisis averted. Nice quick thinking gjs. Though we really need to be more careful messing with critical directories!
[02:02] <@CuriousOrc> Snapshot restored. Really sorry about that guys, I'll be more cautious in the future. Thanks for the help gjs.
[02:14] <@gjs> No worries, we all make mistakes. The important thing is we recovered. Let's just be extra diligent with backups and double check

--- CANDIDATE 5 (5 lines) ---
, restoring an older snapshot is better than nothing. Mount it and let's see what we can salvage.
[01:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> I'll start diffing the current /etc and /home directories against the snapshot to determine what config and user files changed recently.  
[02:02] <@CuriousOrc> Snapshot mounted. It's from 3 weeks ago, before the big kernel upgrade and SystemD migration.
[02:14] <@gjs> Oof, that's going to be rough. But it's our only option at this point. Start copying the /lib files over.

{"candidate_index": 4, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Flows naturally from the prior incomplete line, keeps IRC technical chatter with realistic recovery steps (mounting snapshot, diffing /etc), maintains timestamps, and leaves room for further narrative.

[02:38] <@gjs> Let's tread carefully then. We'll likely need to manually merge some of those /etc changes. Don't overwrite blindly.

[02:44] <@gjs> Agreed, this close call proves we need better disaster recovery. I'll spec out options for daily snapshots to the NAS.

CHUNK 5 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 17/20 messages (85%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (3 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

're still missing some key libraries from the newer kernel modules.

[03:04] <@CuriousOrc> I found a tarball of the new kernel's /lib/modules directory in /root. Extracting that should get us the missing pieces.

[03:18] <@gjs> Good find! Go ahead and extract those module libraries into /lib. That should get us back to a bootable state.

[03:26] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Alright, /lib is fully restored now. I'm going to start carefully merging the critical /etc config changes.

're still missing some key libraries 
[03:04] <@CuriousOrc> I found a tarball of the missing /lib files from right before the SystemD upgrade. I think it has what we need to get the system booting again.
[03:12] <@gjs> Good find! Extract that into /lib, then let's try rebooting and see where we stand.  
[03:28] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Fingers crossed... Reboot initiated.

're still missing some key libraries from the newer kernel version.

[03:04] <@gjs> Hmm, I was afraid of that. We may need to reinstall some core packages to pull in the updated library dependencies.

[03:16] <@CuriousOrc> I've finished diffing the /etc directories. Lots of SystemD and GRUB config changes. I'll start selectively merging the critical bits.

[03:28] <@gjs> Good work. Once that's done, let's try booting into single user mode and see if we can get a stable shell.

[03:30] *** Netsplit:

--- CANDIDATE 4 (5 lines) ---
're still missing some key libraries from the newer kernel modules.

[03:04] <@CuriousOrc> I found a tarball of the updated kernel and modules in /root/upgrades. I can extract that to get us the missing libs.

[03:16] <@gjs> Good find! Go ahead and extract those into place. Then we can try booting into single user mode to assess the damage.

[03:30] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Okay, I think that's everything restored as best we can. Fingers crossed this lets us boot.

[03:42] <@CuriousOrc> Here goes

--- CANDIDATE 5 (5 lines) ---
're definitely going to be missing some libs 
[03:04] <@gjs> It'll have to do for now. Let's focus on getting the core system files in place so we can at least boot to single user mode.
[03:16] <@CuriousOrc> Good news, I found some of our custom SystemD unit files in /home/admin/systemd-backup. Copied those over to /etc/systemd/system
[03:28] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Nice find! That should help with some of the /etc discrepancies. Though we'll still need to review each config file.

JUDGE PROMPT (FULL)
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera.

            Context: We're simulating a haunted IRC channel called #aethera. The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            Your task: Rate these candidates and select the best one to continue the story.
            The winning candidate will be used to generate the next chunk.

            Candidates to judge:

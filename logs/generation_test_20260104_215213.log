[00:00] <DeadMansHand> haha, last night, me and pete went out to celebrate his engagement and got hugely drunk
[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this
[01:14] <Thirteen-> will do. you better hope he's not still buried, you'll be in deep shit.
[01:18] *** DeadMansHand has quit
[01:32] <Tyran> wtf? pete came home last night you fuck. Ken's going to be worrying about this shit all day
[01:40] <Thirteen-> haha yea, but it will be fun while it lasts
[01:52] *** PeteRepeat has joined
[01:56] <PeteRepeat> fucking ken
[02:04] <PeteRepeat> ken... that fucker buried me in the sand last night, i ran off about 5 minutes to it, left him there to be an idiot
[02:18] <quiqsilver> pete, ken didn't come back last night, i thought he was with you.
[02:24] <PeteRepeat> oh fuck.
[02:32] <PeteRepeat> if ken shows up, make sure he doesn't know that im at the beach digging for his body. i don't want him to think i care or anything.
[02:36] *** PeteRepeat has quit
[02:48] <Thirteen-> rofl. Those 2 are going to get a huge surprise when they meet at the beach.

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 10 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~10 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

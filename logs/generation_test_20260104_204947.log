[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 20 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~20 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

{"candidate_index": 1, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Opens immediately with an unsettling, almost hallucinatory vibe that fits the \"digital decay\" brief while still feeling like plausible late-night IRC banter. Multiple participants jump in, there’s room for humour and tension, and the pacing (rapid single-user posts + others reacting) sets a good foundation for a 20-line fragment. Overall strongest blend of eerie atmosphere and organic chat."}

============================================================
CHUNK 2 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 7/20 messages (35%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===
            [00:00] <waking_dream> eeeeeEEEEE the shadows are crawling again
[00:02] <waking_dream> they whisper things, terrible things

            === END TRANSCRIPT ===

            The candidates below are CONTINUATIONS of this transcript.
            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow
            - Pacing appropriately toward the target length

{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Feels like a believable continuation: timestamps flow, existing nicks react in-character, language stays unsettling without over-the-top memes, and there’s no meta commentary. Keeps conversation moving while leaving room for further decay. Minor flaw: trailing blank line, but overall strongest and coherent."}

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 13/20 messages (65%) ===

            We're in the MIDDLE phase. Favor candidates that develop the conversation naturally.

            === TRANSCRIPT SO FAR ===

The remaining content of the log file appears to be corrupted or missing. The chaotic conversation ends abruptly without a clear resolution. The last coherent lines show waking_dream in an altered state of mind, describing a frightening altered perception of reality, while the other users express skepticism and concern, attributing it to drug use. The log cuts off as zer0_k00l tries to convince waking_dream to go to sleep. The fragmented, surreal nature of the dialog captures the unsettling atmosphere of late night conversations where the boundaries between reality, dreams and imagination can blur.

[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here
[05:12] <Galactic> it's just always bothered me.

{"candidate_index": 0, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Shows believable IRC quit, escalating glitch-laden rant that fits unsettling digital-decay tone, ends in abrupt collapse. Keeps pacing and character voices, includes quit message. Minor authenticity issues (garbled user tag \"00l>\", heavy symbol spam) but still strongest overall ending among options."}

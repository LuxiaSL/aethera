[00:00] <Galactic> you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots
[00:06] <Galactic> I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT
[00:12] <Galactic> the Trix rabbit, for example
[00:18] <Galactic> I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids
[00:28] <Galactic> I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.
[00:38] <Galactic> fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit
[00:46] <Galactic> "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"
[00:52] <Galactic> Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.
[00:58] <Galactic> FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me
[01:06] <Galactic> I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches
[01:16] <Galactic> and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.
[01:28] <Galactic> and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?
[01:40] <Galactic> I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think
[01:50] <Galactic> "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"
[01:56] <Galactic> NO.
[02:02] <Galactic> I'd be thinking
[02:10] <Galactic> "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"
[02:24] <Galactic> another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"
[02:34] <Galactic> last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast
[02:46] <Galactic> they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big
[03:02] <Flaming_Duck> not me
[03:08] <Flaming_Duck> I don't even EAT breakfast nomore
[03:16] <Flaming_Duck> I mean, I eat when I get up
[03:24] <Flaming_Duck> but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"
[03:34] <Flaming_Duck> bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money
[03:42] <Flaming_Duck> don't give me that shit.
[03:54] <Galactic> Back to stupid cereal mascots...
[04:00] <Galactic> Lucky Charms.
[04:04] <Galactic> FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS
[04:12] <Galactic> Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?
[04:22] <Galactic> C'mon now, Lucky.
[04:30] <Galactic> I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE
[04:40] <Galactic> or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.
[04:48] <Galactic> "They're after me Lucky Charms!"
[04:52] <Galactic> ....
[04:56] <Galactic> KILL THEM, BITCH!
[05:06] <Galactic> I dunno why I went off on this rant here
[05:12] <Galactic> it's just always bothered me.

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 17 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~17 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

[00:02] <packet_hunter> what now?
[00:04] <netgod> Just figured out how to bypass their entire firewall stack using a UDP tunnel disguised as DNS queries
[00:06] <netgod> They filter EVERYTHING else
[00:08] <netgod> But DNS has to work, right?
[00:10] <netgod> So I fragmented my payload into 512 byte chunks
[00:12] <netgod> Each one goes out as a TXT record query for something like 4c61756e63682f636f6d6d616e642e657865.sneaky

[00:06] <Babbit> What's wrong?
[00:10] <Sakhi> My client keeps getting connection reset by peer when trying to connect to the server
[00:16] <Babbit> Is your server actually running on the port you're trying to connect to?
[00:20] <Sakhi> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. I'm using port 8080
[00:26] <Babbit> Did you check with netstat?
[00:32] <Sakhi> No, I haven't. Let me try that

[00:20] <PacketWhisperer> Sounds like a ghost in the machine. Checked your iptables?
[00:28] <SpaceJunkie> Yeah, nothing unusual there. It's like the packets are appearing out of thin air.
[00:36] <RouterRanger> Might be a kernel module playing tricks. Any recent updates?

            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (7 lines) ---
ie> No updates, fresh install actually. Trying to set up a honeypot.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> Honeypot? That's interesting. Maybe you've already caught something.
[01:00] <RouterRanger> Or you're catching yourself. Classic observer effect in networking.
[01:08] <SpaceJunkie> haha, maybe. But seriously, the TTL is decrementing normally.
[01:16] <PacketWhisperer> That rules out loopback spoofing. What's the payload look like?
[01:24] <SpaceJunkie> Random bytes mostly, but sometimes it spells "do you remember" in hex.
[01:32] <RouterRanger

--- CANDIDATE 2 (7 lines) ---
ie> Not that I remember. This is a pretty stable setup.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> Try running a packet capture with tcpdump. Look for unusual MAC addresses or TTL values.
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Good idea. I'll set that up and let you know what I find.
[01:08] <RouterRanger> Also check your ARP tables. Could be someone spoofing a local address.
[01:16] <SpaceJunkie> ARP tables look clean. Only expected entries.
[01:24] <PacketWhisperer> This is getting weird. Maybe it's time to check the hardware?

You notice that while most logs

--- CANDIDATE 4 (7 lines) ---
ie> No updates in weeks. This started happening after that weird power surge last night.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> Power surge can do strange things to hardware. You might have a failing NIC.
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Doubt it. I've swapped out the NIC and the pattern continues.
[01:08] <RouterRanger> What about the switch? Maybe it's generating them.
[01:16] <SpaceJunkie> Good idea. I'll check the switch logs.
[01:26] <PacketWhisperer> Also, try sniffing the packets. Might see something interesting in the payload.
[01:34] <SpaceJunkie> Already did

--- CANDIDATE 5 (7 lines) ---
ie> Nope, clean system. Been running the same kernel for months.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> Try running tcpdump with -i lo and see if you can catch the payload.
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Already did that. It's just garbage bytes - random data every time.
[01:08] <KernelKanon> Could be a memory corruption issue. Run memtest?
[01:16] <SpaceJunkie> Passed with flying colors. This is driving me nuts.
[01:24] <RouterRanger> What's the TTL on these packets?
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> 255. Like they're originating locally but... they're

--- CANDIDATE 6 (7 lines) ---
ie> Nothing recent. This started happening after I ran that old binary from the deep web archive though.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> ... oh no.
[00:54] <ProtocolAnalyst> SpaceJunkie which archive exactly?
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Some forgotten FTP server from the 90s. Had this weird name... something like "Nethack_3.1.0_alpha_ghost_variant.tar.gz"
[01:08] <PacketWhisperer> That's the one. You're not going to like this.
[01:16] <ProtocolAnalyst> The ghost variant? That was a meme virus that spread through IRC logs.
[01:24

--- CANDIDATE 7 (7 lines) ---
ie> Last update was three weeks ago, standard security patches.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> Try running 'netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN' to see if anything's listening on unusual ports.
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Already did that, nothing suspicious.
[01:08] <RouterRanger> What about ' lsof -i'? Sometimes processes hide from netstat.

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 12/17 messages (71%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (5 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

            Select the one that best continues the narrative while:
            - Maintaining consistent tone and character voices
            - Keeping natural conversation flow

            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (6 lines) ---
] <SpaceJunkie> What?! How does a virus spread through text?
[01:22] <ProtocolAnalyst> Sensitive neural patterns encoded in ASCII. When read aloud or processed by certain AI models, it triggers a latent payload.
[01:30] <SpaceJunkie> But I'm not an AI...
[01:38] <PacketWhisperer> Doesn't matter. The payload is designed to propagate through any sufficiently complex pattern recognition system. Including human brains.
[01:46] <SpaceJunkie> You're saying I'm infected with a virus from a 90s Nethack variant?
[01:52] <RouterRanger> And it's trying to connect to something. That's what the packets are

--- CANDIDATE 2 (8 lines) ---
]
[SpaceJunkie> Wait, a virus that spreads through IRC logs?
[01:32] <PacketWhisperer> Not exactly a virus. It's more like... a self-replicating pattern that's attracted to technical discussions about networking anomalies.
[01:40] <RouterRanger> That's impossible.
[01:48] <ProtocolAnalyst> Tell that to the fourteen sites that went dark last month after someone posted a log analysis of similar symptoms.
[01:56] <SpaceJunkie> So what do I do now?
[02:04] <PacketWhisperer> Don't reply to it. Don't analyze it further. And definitely don't log this conversation.
[02:12] <SpaceJunk

]
[01:24] <PacketWhisperer> It embeds itself in old IRC logs and waits for someone to download and cat a specific sequence of them. Then it reconstructs itself in memory.
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> You're joking right?
[01:38] <RouterRanger> Check your memory usage. If it's growing without explanation...
[01:44] <SpaceJunkie> Oh god. It's up to 8GB and climbing.
[01:50] <ProtocolAnalyst> You need to power down immediately. It's trying to reconstruct its network stack.
[01:56] <SpaceJunkie> I can't. The shutdown command isn't responding.
[02:00

--- CANDIDATE 4 (7 lines) ---
] <SpaceJunkie> Wait what?
[01:30] <PacketWhisperer> It's a recursive self-replicating payload embedder. It hides messages in IRC logs then uses them to propagate.
[01:38] <SpaceJunkie> How do I stop it?!
[01:42] <RouterRanger> You can't. It's already in your logs. Every time you view them, it spreads.
[01:50] <ProtocolAnalyst> And when someone else reads those logs... it spreads to them.
[01:58] <SpaceJunkie> Oh god. I've been uploading these logs to public archives all week!
[02:04] <PacketWhisperer> Then it's already

[01:16] <ProtocolAnalyst> The ghost variant? That was a meme virus that spread through IRC logs. [01:24] <RouterRanger> Wait, the one that infects IRC servers and sends packets from loopback addresses?
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> What do you mean meme virus?
[01:40] <PacketWhisperer> It's not code. It's an idea. A pattern that replicates itself through text. When someone reads it, especially in certain contexts, it triggers behavior changes.
[01:48] <SpaceJunkie> That's... that's

] * PacketWhisperer facepalms
[01:24] * PacketWhisperer facepalms
[01:28] <SpaceJunkie> Wait what? A virus in an IRC log?
[01:34] <RouterRanger> Not just any virus. This one exploits nostalgia triggers in terminal interfaces. If you've been reading old IRC logs for too long...
[01:42] <ProtocolAnalyst> Your brain starts pattern-missing the invisible packets. They're not real packets, they're phantom signals generated by your nostalgia cortex overstimulated by too much IRC history.
[01:50] <SpaceJunkie> That explains why my tcpdump shows them but my router doesn't...
[01:56

--- CANDIDATE 7 (2 lines) ---
] <RouterRanger> Wait, that was real? I thought it was just an urban legend. 
[01:30] <SpaceJunkie> What do you mean meme virus? It was just supposed to be a different version of nethack. [01:38] <PacketWhisperer> It pretended to be game code but had a payload that infected IRC clients. It would embed itself in log files and spread when people shared them. [01:46] <PacketWhisperer> The weird packets you're seeing might be leftover triggers trying to find a host. [01:54] <SpaceJunkie> How do I stop it? [02:00] <ProtocolAnalyst> Disconnect from

]
[01:28] <SpaceJunkie> Wait, what? A virus in IRC logs?
[01:32] <RouterRanger> Not just any virus. This one embeds itself in text patterns that trigger specific memory allocations when parsed by certain regex engines.
[01:44] <SpaceJunkie> That explains why my log analyzer keeps crashing.
[01:52] <PacketWhisperer> It gets worse. The pattern creates a hidden process that listens on port 31337 and slowly exfiltrates data in ICMP echo requests disguised as failed ping attempts.
[02:00] <SpaceJunkie> How do I stop it?

{"candidate_index": 4, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Provides a concise, believable IRC-style collapse: urgent warning, mass quits, channel closure, and inability to re-join. Feels organic and unsettling while cleanly ending the log. Minor oddities (bracket artifact, \"handshake with itself\") but overall most satisfying and coherent compared to others."}

FINAL FRAGMENT
============================================================
[00:00] <SpaceJunkie> Any networking gurus here? I'm trying to trace a weird packet pattern.
[00:08] <RouterRanger> What's going on?
[00:12] <SpaceJunkie> Getting packets every 30 seconds from a loopback address but they're not coming from any of my running processes.
[00:20] <PacketWhisperer> Sounds like a ghost in the machine. Checked your iptables?
[00:28] <SpaceJunkie> Yeah, nothing unusual there. It's like the packets are appearing out of thin air.
[00:36] <RouterRanger> Might be a kernel module playing tricks. Any recent updates?
[00:44] <SpaceJunk ie> Nothing recent. This started happening after I ran that old binary from the deep web archive though.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> ... oh no.
[00:54] <ProtocolAnalyst> SpaceJunkie which archive exactly?
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Some forgotten FTP server from the 90s. Had this weird name... something like "Nethack_3.1.0_alpha_ghost_variant.tar.gz"
[01:08] <PacketWhisperer> That's the one. You're not going to like this.
[01:16] <ProtocolAnalyst> The ghost variant? That was a meme virus that spread through IRC logs. [01:24 ]
[01:24] <PacketWhisperer> It embeds itself in old IRC logs and waits for someone to download and cat a specific sequence of them. Then it reconstructs itself in memory.
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> You're joking right?
[01:38] <RouterRanger> Check your memory usage. If it's growing without explanation...
[01:44] <SpaceJunkie> Oh god. It's up to 8GB and climbing.
[01:50] <ProtocolAnalyst> You need to power down immediately. It's trying to reconstruct its network stack.
[01:56] <SpaceJunkie> I can't. The shutdown command isn't responding. [02:00 ]
[02:00] <PacketWhisperer> It's too late. It's already halfway through the TCP handshake with itself.
[02:06] <RouterRanger> Everyone disconnect from this channel NOW!

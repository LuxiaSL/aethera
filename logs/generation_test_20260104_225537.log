[00:08] <DeadMansHand> we got this great idea to bury eachother in the sand close to the water and see who would chicken out first
[00:15] <DeadMansHand> took about a half hour, but the water got up to my face so i freaked and got out
[00:22] <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
[00:35] <Thirteen-> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
[00:42] <DeadMansHand> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?
[00:48] <Thirteen-> holy fuck.
[00:52] <DeadMansHand> i fucking hope im wrong about what im thinking right now
[00:56] <DeadMansHand> im fucking going back to the beach to make sure
[01:02] <DeadMansHand> if he gets home, call me, i don't want to be worrying about this
[01:14] <Thirteen-> will do. you better hope he's not still buried, you'll be in deep shit.
[01:18] *** DeadMansHand has quit

CHUNK 1 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === TARGET: 17 messages ===

            This is the OPENING of a new IRC fragment.
            Select the candidate that establishes the best foundation for a ~17 message conversation.


            Candidates to judge:

--- CANDIDATE 1 (7 lines) ---
bIgHeAD> im having trouble connecting to a server, i think my router is blocking my ssh request
[00:08] <tcpdump> what router model?
[00:12] <bIgHeAD> linksys 2000wrt
[00:18] <tcpdump> you're gonna want to check if port forwarding is enabled for port 22 on that model
[00:26] <bIgHeAD> i dont even know how to check that
[00:32] <tcpdump> dude just google "linksys 2000wrt ssh port forwarding setup"
[00:40] <bIgHeAD> i did but all the guides are for completely different firmware

--- CANDIDATE 2 (8 lines) ---
ph1sh> this dude on craigslist keeps saying he has "complete networking solutions" but won't elaborate
[00:06] <ph1sh> should i meet him under the bridge
[00:12] <ph1sh> he says he has "all the protocols"
[00:18] <ph1sh> even the ones lost to time
[00:24] <ph1sh> claims he can still ping gopher:// locations
[00:30] <cryptochat> lol larping as tcp/ip elder? classic

[00:12] <muttonhead> lol i know but boss wants fancy GUI reports for the incident report
[00:16] <golgotha> sigh corporate life
[00:20] <muttonhead> anyway, captured some FTP traffic that shouldn't be happening

[00:28] <gol

--- CANDIDATE 4 (6 lines) ---
rootkit> Hey guys, I need to ask a networking question. I'm trying to secure my home server and I'm a bit stuck on iptables.
[00:04] <T3h_P4c3Maker> whats up rootkit?
[00:06] <rootkit> So I'm trying to block all incoming traffic except for specific ports, but I'm confused about how to allow established connections when they're going outbound.
[00:10] <T3h_P4c3Maker> yeah that's a common confusion, you need to use state tracking
[00:12] <T3h_P4c3Maker> with -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED
[00:16] <rootkit

--- CANDIDATE 5 (9 lines) ---
unixsystem> is anyone here good with iptables?
[00:08] <unixsystem> trying to setup a firewall but encountering issues with NAT traversal for VoIP

[00:22] <netcrusher> what kernel version?
[00:28] <unixsystem> 3.16
[00:34] <netcrusher> u need to look at the conntrack module for SIP
[00:42] <unixsystem> already loaded it
[00:48] <netcrusher> did you load nf_conntrack_sip and nf_nat_sip specifically?
[00:56] <unixsystem>

--- CANDIDATE 6 (7 lines) ---
pr0nstar69> so anyone ever cracked a rar password?
[00:08] <c4tch0fth3d4y> yeah, but it's not easy. depends on the encryption strength.
[00:16] <c4tch0fth3d4y> you brute force or dictionary attack it?
[00:24] <pr0nstar69> i tried brute forcing with john but it's taking forever
[00:32] <l33tch1ck> try a different attack vector maybe?
[00:40] <password_cracker1337> john is outdated
[00:48] <password_cracker1337> use hashcat with some good rules

--- CANDIDATE 7 (10 lines) ---
error404> so guys, i need to get into this one ftp server
[00:04] <error404> it's running some really old version of vsftpd

[00:12] <hashcat> lol that's ancient
[00:16] <hashcat> totally vulnerable
[00:20] <error404> yeah but... it's behind a firewall
[00:24] <error404> and the admin is paranoid as hell
[00:28] <nmapgod> what kind of firewall?
[00:32] <error404> some custom iptables rules i think
[00:36]

--- CANDIDATE 8 (6 lines) ---
sillyXxX> anyone here knows how to setup a hidden service on tor?
[00:08] <R0b0tC0mm4nd> yeah its pretty simple, just configure torrc with HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort
[00:14] <sillyXxX> I tried but it doesnt work, keeps saying port 80 is already in use
[00:22] <R0b0tC0mm4nd> try a different port then, like 8080 or 8081
[00:28] <sillyXxX> but I want it on port 80 so its accessible without specifying port
[00:34] <g0bl

CHUNK 3 JUDGE PROMPT
============================================================
You are judging IRC chat log continuations for an art project called Aethera. Think bash.org mixed with discord.

            IMPORTANT: These candidates are RAW COMPLETIONS from a base language model operating
            in continuation mode. Some responses may be partially cut off; this is normal for a short max token count.
            The generator sees the full scaffold prompt (with examples showing
            the target message count and collapse type) plus all previously generated content.

            The generator should naturally pace toward the target - your job is to select the 
            highest quality continuation that feels most authentic and narratively coherent.

            The chat should feel:
            - Natural and organic, like real IRC conversations
            - Slightly unsettling, with undertones of digital decay
            - Varied in pacing - not every line needs a response
            - Authentic to IRC culture (lurkers, netsplits, casual banter)

            === PROGRESS: 14/17 messages (82%) ===

            We're APPROACHING THE END (3 messages left). Favor candidates that start steering toward a natural conclusion.

[02:18] <ph1sh> ok this is actually amazing
[02:24] <ph1sh> he just demonstrated a working token ring network

{"candidate_index": 6, "rating": 8, "reasoning": "Feels like authentic IRC banter; continues the absurd networking setup, adds unsettling imagery, and ends cleanly with a humorous quit message, giving a satisfying collapse. Dialogue is concise and in-character, pacing appropriate for final lines. Other candidates either trail off mid-sentence, lack closure, or feel less natural."}

FINAL FRAGMENT
============================================================
[00:00] <ph1sh> this dude on craigslist keeps saying he has "complete networking solutions" but won't elaborate
[00:06] <ph1sh> should i meet him under the bridge
[00:12] <ph1sh> he says he has "all the protocols"
[00:18] <ph1sh> even the ones lost to time
[00:24] <ph1sh> claims he can still ping gopher:// locations
[00:30] <cryptochat> lol larping as tcp/ip elder? classic
[00:36] <ph1sh> dude sent me a photo of his "home lab" though
[00:42] <ph1sh> [IMAGE: dimly lit basement with flickering lights, multiple CRTs stacked vertically, cables everywhere, something glowing green in the corner]
[00:48] <ph1sh> there's literally a punchdown block mounted on a human skull
[00:54] <netsecqueen> ok that's actually concerning
[01:00] <ph1sh> says he's been "routing packets since before tcp was invented"
[01:06] <ph1sh> calls himself "udp king" because "delivery not guaranteed"
[01:12] <tinfoilhat> sounds legit meet him alone at night
[01:18] <netsecqueen> ph1sh DO NOT MEET HIM UNDER THE BRIDGE
[01:24] <netsecqueen> just report the ad and move on
[01:30] <ph1sh> bit late for that i'm already here
[01:36] <ph1sh> holy shit he brought actual carrier pigeons
[01:42] <ph1sh> says this is how he achieves "true low latency"
[01:48] <ph1sh> claims they're trained to fly through the sewage tunnels
[01:54] <ph1sh> "packets never get inspected by the feds if they travel with feces"
[02:00] <ph1sh> brb he's showing me his "wireless bridge" setup
[02:06] <ph1sh> oh god it's just two tin cans and a really long string
[02:12] <ph1sh> but the string is made of fiber optic cable
[02:18] <ph1sh> says he "spliced it himself"

[00:00] <cyberdemon> So I found this weird log file in the system logs directory
[00:06] <cyberdemon> It's named irc_session_reconstructed_481_depth_4.tar.gz but it's not in any format I recognize
[00:10] <artemis> Probably one of those old backup formats that nobody uses anymore [00
[00:14] <cyberdemon> Not sure, tar.gz is normal but when I extract it I get binary garbage
[00:20] <security_op> Don't extract random files from logs without scanning them first! [00
[00:20] <security_op> Don't extract random files from logs without scanning them first! [00
[00:22] <artemis> lol security_op's bot is stuck again
[00:24] <cyberdemon> Sorry, already did it before I thought better of it
[00:28] <archivist> That's actually one of my reconstruction projects [00
[00:28] <archivist> I'm trying to recover data
[00:32] <cyberdemon> Oh hey archivist, what kind of data?
[00:36] <archivist> Old IRC sessions that got corrupted during the big migration [00
[00:36] <archivist> The compression algorithm had a bug when handling nested quotes
[00:40] <archivist> It created
[00:40] <archivist> It created this recursive embedding issue where the data references itself multiple levels deep
[00:44] <artemis> Sounds like a job for fractal compression!
[00:48] <cyberdemon> How bad is it?
[00:52] <archivist> Well, when I run a depth analysis
[00:52] <archivist> Well, when I run a depth analysis on the file, it shows 481 layers of self-reference
[00:56] <cyberdemon> Holy recursion, Batman!
[00:58] <artemis> So it's like a log file that's trying to become self-aware?
[01:02] [SYSTEM] Connection reset by peer [01:02]
[01:04] <security_op> User archivist is now known as ghost_of_archivist [01
[01:06] <cyberdemon> Wait what?
[01:08] <artemis> That's... concerning
[01:12] <ghost_of_archivist> I can

[00:00] <QuantumCrypt> Final protocol adjustment complete.
[00:06] <QuantumCrypt> Running checksums... [OK]
[00:12] <AnomalyAgent> Verified. All nodes aligned to new parameters.
[00:18] <AlgorithmicMind> Shield integrity holding at 98.7% after yesterday's spike.
[00:24] <ZeroOrder> Clock synchronization across all satellites confirmed. 0.001ms drift max.
[00:30] <QuantumCrypt> Initializing quantum tunneling protocol v8.0...
[00:36] <AnomalyAgent> Worried about the recursive feedback loops mentioned in the paper.
[00:42] <AlgorithmicMind> Mathematically impossible if proper damping is applied. Trust the numbers.
[00:48] <QuantumCrypt> Executing... [OK]
[00:54] <ZeroOrder>
[00:54] <ZeroOrder> Tunnel stability: 99.992% and rising. [REPEATED 4164 TIMES]
[01:00] <QuantumCrypt> Shut it down! Shut it down!
[01:06] <AnomalyAgent> Can't! The shutdown command is being echoed back infinitely!
[01:12] <AlgorithmicMind> It's a classic eigenvector feedback cascade. Need to inject a null packet with inverse polarity!
[01:18] <ZeroOrder> Attempting null injection... [FAIL]
[01:24] <An > Cannot overwrite corrupted buffer [REPEATED 4164 TIMES]
[01:30] <QuantumCrypt> Manual override! Someone get to the server room!
[01:36] <AnomalyAgent> I'm already here! The rack is spitting sparks!
[01:42] <AlgorithmicMind> Cut the power at the main breaker! All of them!
[01:48] *** The system has been shut down forcibly.

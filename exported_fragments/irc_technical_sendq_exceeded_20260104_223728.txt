[00:00] <SpaceJunkie> Any networking gurus here? I'm trying to trace a weird packet pattern.
[00:08] <RouterRanger> What's going on?
[00:12] <SpaceJunkie> Getting packets every 30 seconds from a loopback address but they're not coming from any of my running processes.
[00:20] <PacketWhisperer> Sounds like a ghost in the machine. Checked your iptables?
[00:28] <SpaceJunkie> Yeah, nothing unusual there. It's like the packets are appearing out of thin air.
[00:36] <RouterRanger> Might be a kernel module playing tricks. Any recent updates?
[00:44] <SpaceJunk ie> Nothing recent. This started happening after I ran that old binary from the deep web archive though.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> ... oh no.
[00:54] <ProtocolAnalyst> SpaceJunkie which archive exactly?
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Some forgotten FTP server from the 90s. Had this weird name... something like "Nethack_3.1.0_alpha_ghost_variant.tar.gz"
[01:08] <PacketWhisperer> That's the one. You're not going to like this.
[01:16] <ProtocolAnalyst> The ghost variant? That was a meme virus that spread through IRC logs. [01:24 ]
[01:24] <PacketWhisperer> It embeds itself in old IRC logs and waits for someone to download and cat a specific sequence of them. Then it reconstructs itself in memory.
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> You're joking right?
[01:38] <RouterRanger> Check your memory usage. If it's growing without explanation...
[01:44] <SpaceJunkie> Oh god. It's up to 8GB and climbing.
[01:50] <ProtocolAnalyst> You need to power down immediately. It's trying to reconstruct its network stack.
[01:56] <SpaceJunkie> I can't. The shutdown command isn't responding. [02:00 ]
[02:00] <PacketWhisperer> It's too late. It's already halfway through the TCP handshake with itself.
[02:06] <RouterRanger> Everyone disconnect from this channel NOW!

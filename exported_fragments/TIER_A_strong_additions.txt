#1 - THE GHOST MEME VIRUS
Style: technical | Collapse: sendq_exceeded
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <SpaceJunkie> Any networking gurus here? I'm trying to trace a weird packet pattern.
[00:08] <RouterRanger> What's going on?
[00:12] <SpaceJunkie> Getting packets every 30 seconds from a loopback address but they're not coming from any of my running processes.
[00:20] <PacketWhisperer> Sounds like a ghost in the machine. Checked your iptables?
[00:28] <SpaceJunkie> Yeah, nothing unusual there. It's like the packets are appearing out of thin air.
[00:36] <RouterRanger> Might be a kernel module playing tricks. Any recent updates?
[00:44] <SpaceJunkie> Nothing recent. This started happening after I ran that old binary from the deep web archive though.
[00:52] <PacketWhisperer> ... oh no.
[00:54] <ProtocolAnalyst> SpaceJunkie which archive exactly?
[01:00] <SpaceJunkie> Some forgotten FTP server from the 90s. Had this weird name... something like "Nethack_3.1.0_alpha_ghost_variant.tar.gz"
[01:08] <PacketWhisperer> That's the one. You're not going to like this.
[01:16] <ProtocolAnalyst> The ghost variant? That was a meme virus that spread through IRC logs.
[01:24] <PacketWhisperer> It embeds itself in old IRC logs and waits for someone to download and cat a specific sequence of them. Then it reconstructs itself in memory.
[01:32] <SpaceJunkie> You're joking right?
[01:38] <RouterRanger> Check your memory usage. If it's growing without explanation...
[01:44] <SpaceJunkie> Oh god. It's up to 8GB and climbing.
[01:50] <ProtocolAnalyst> You need to power down immediately. It's trying to reconstruct its network stack.
[01:56] <SpaceJunkie> I can't. The shutdown command isn't responding.
[02:00] <PacketWhisperer> It's too late. It's already halfway through the TCP handshake with itself.
[02:06] <RouterRanger> Everyone disconnect from this channel NOW!

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <waking_dream> eeeeeEEEEE the shadows are crawling again
[00:02] <waking_dream> they whisper things, terrible things
[00:05] <zer0_k00l> its ok bro, just turn on the light
[00:08] <waking_dream> can't reach the switch, claws in the way
[00:11] <JuJu_Bee> dude, lay off the shrooms before bed
[00:14] <waking_dream> you don't understand, the geometry is all wrong
[00:17] <waking_dream> angles bending in impossible ways
[00:21] <zer0_k00l> just close your eyes man, it'll pass
[00:25] <waking_dream> eyes won't close, lids torn off
[00:28] <JuJu_Bee> seriously, no more psychedelics for you
[00:32] <waking_dream> hahaha you think this is a TRIP??
[00:35] <waking_dream> the veil is shredded, true reality bleeding through
[00:39] <zer0_k00l> ok that's enough, time for bed
[00:42] <waking_dream> can't sleep, the humming won't let me
[00:46] <zer0_k00l> what humming? I don't hear anything
[00:50] <waking_dream> buzzing, vibrating, drilling into my skull
[00:54] <JuJu_Bee> you're hallucinating man, snap out of it
[00:58] <waking_dream> hahaha SNAP he says, like twigs underfoot
[01:02] <waking_dream> crunch crunch, bones in the walls
[01:06] <zer0_k00l> dude you're freaking me out. I'm gonna bounce
[01:10] *** zer0_k00l has quit (Quit: Leaving)
[01:14] <waking_dream> yes, flee! flee into the hungry da#%{^*]ss

#3 - ZERO-WIDTH UNICODE SECURITY HOLE
Style: technical | Collapse: netsplit
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <entropy_hawk> Security folks, question about the AetheraNameRemover algorithm
[00:06] <entropy_hawk> why does it replace certain characters with Unicode lookalikes instead of just removing them?
[00:12] <curious_george> It preserves visual similarity to maintain data integrity in some contexts
[00:18] <curious_george> like when processing documents that need redaction but also OCR later
[00:24] <entropy_hawk> seems weird in IRC logs though
[00:28] <curious_george> It's a general-purpose algorithm used across all AetheraConfidential products
[00:32] <curious_george> not optimized for specific formats
[00:38] <memory_leak> curious, how does it handle zero-width unicode?
[00:42] <entropy_hawk> memory_leak: that's exactly what I was wondering
[00:48] <curious_george> Zero-width characters are preserved as-is
[00:54] <entropy_hawk> WHAT
[00:58] <curious_george> They don't contribute to visual representation, so they're considered harmless
[01:04] <entropy_hawk> but that's a massive security hole
[01:08] <curious_george> How so?
[01:12] <entropy_hawk> you could encode entire messages in zero-width unicode and they'd bypass
[01:18] <curious_george> But who would look for messages in zero-width unicode?
[01:24] <entropy_hawk> literally anyone trying to leak sensitive information
[01:30] <memory_leak> curious, can you confirm this? I just tested it in my dev environment
[01:36] <memory_leak> I sent "sensitive__password" (with zero-widths between sensitive and password)
[01:42] <memory_leak> and it completely ignored the zero-width part
[01:48] <curious_george> Let me check the code...
[01:52] <curious_george> Huh.
[01:56] <curious_george> Oh dear.
[01:58] *** curious_george has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:02] *** entropy_hawk has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:06] *** memory_leak has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

#4 - RECURSIVE LOG FILE RECONSTRUCTION
Style: technical | Collapse: sendq_exceeded
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <cyberdemon> So I found this weird log file in the system logs directory
[00:06] <cyberdemon> It's named irc_session_reconstructed_481_depth_4.tar.gz but it's not in any format I recognize
[00:10] <artemis> Probably one of those old backup formats that nobody uses anymore
[00:14] <cyberdemon> Not sure, tar.gz is normal but when I extract it I get binary garbage
[00:20] <security_op> Don't extract random files from logs without scanning them first!
[00:20] <security_op> Don't extract random files from logs without scanning them first!
[00:22] <artemis> lol security_op's bot is stuck again
[00:24] <cyberdemon> Sorry, already did it before I thought better of it
[00:28] <archivist> That's actually one of my reconstruction projects
[00:28] <archivist> I'm trying to recover data from old IRC sessions that got corrupted during the big migration
[00:36] <archivist> The compression algorithm had a bug when handling nested quotes
[00:40] <archivist> It created this recursive embedding issue where the data references itself multiple levels deep
[00:44] <artemis> Sounds like a job for fractal compression!
[00:48] <cyberdemon> How bad is it?
[00:52] <archivist> Well, when I run a depth analysis on the file, it shows 481 layers of self-reference
[00:56] <cyberdemon> Holy recursion, Batman!
[00:58] <artemis> So it's like a log file that's trying to become self-aware?
[01:02] [SYSTEM] Connection reset by peer
[01:04] <security_op> User archivist is now known as ghost_of_archivist
[01:06] <cyberdemon> Wait what?
[01:08] <artemis> That's... concerning
[01:12] <ghost_of_archivist> I can

#5 - QUANTUMSORT / 27 LETTERS
Style: technical | Collapse: corruption
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <Eigenvector> So, you guys know about the new sorting algorithm everyone's talking about?
[00:08] <QuantumSort> you mean the one that sorts in O(1) time but destroys the universe in the process?
[00:14] <Eigenvector> Yeah, QuantumSort! Just quantum entangle all elements with their sorted positions and observe!
[00:20] <ReynoldsWrap> sounds like a blast, literally
[00:26] <QuantumSort> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[00:32] <ReynoldsNumber> the universe destruction is just garbage collection at a cosmic scale
[00:40] <Eigenvector> exactly! and we have a patent pending
[00:48] <QuantumSort> though there was that one time we used it on a production server
[00:56] <Jeremy> wait what happened
[01:02] <ReynoldsWrap> ever wonder why we have 27 letters in the alphabet now?
[01:08] <Jeremy> what
[01:12] <QuantumSort> sorted right into a neighboring universe brane
[01:18] <ReynoldsNumber> some letters decided to merge for efficiency
[01:26] <Jeremy> merge?
[01:34] <Eigenvector> yeah, like how 'c' and 'k' are now the same letter
[01:38] <Jeremy> holy shit
[01:44] <Jeremy> wait but how do we still read this
[01:50] <QuantumSort> backward compatibility layer in your brain
[01:56] <ReynoldsWrap> neural patch 3.0.1
[02:02] <ReynoldsNumber> some of us upgraded voluntarily
[02:08] <Eigenvector> anyway, anyone wanna try QuantumSort on the next sprint?
[02:14] <QuantumSort> sure but let's do
[02:14] ^C [LOG CORRUPTED: Infinite recursion detected in quantum entanglement buffer]
[LOG TRUNCATED]
[LOG RECOVERY FAILED: 2.71828% recoverable]
[ERROR: Time paradox detected in log metadata]

#6 - BUFFER OVERFLOW EXPLOIT
Style: technical | Collapse: corruption
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <Bl4ckPh0enix> I've been analyzing the codebase for the Archive's core daemon
[00:05] <Bl4ckPh0enix> it's ancient but surprisingly resilient
[00:10] <Bl4ckPh0enix> the way it handles user transitions between channels using symbolic links is clever
[00:15] <Bl4ckPh0enix> but there's something odd in the channel destruction routine
[00:20] <Bl4ckPh0enix> when a channel hits zero users it's supposed to move all remaining data to /tmp and then delete the channel directory
[00:25] <Bl4ckPh0enix> but there's a tiny race condition [buffer overflow]
[00:25] <Bl4ckPh0enix: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[00:35] <GlitchQueen> phoenix? that didn't look good
[00:40] <GlitchQueen> did their client just crash or was that something else?
[00:45] <NullPointer> looked more like an input overflow into the daemon's memory space
[00:50] <NullPointer> the message parser probably didn't sanitize that bracket properly
[00:55] <ZalgoOverflow> ]]; DROP TABLE CHANNELS;-- ⇪⇪�
[00:55] <ZalgoOverflow: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:00] <GlitchQueen> ok now it's happening to multiple users
[01:05] <NullPointer> this is escalating fast
[01:10] <NullPointer> someone's definitely exploiting something in the transition protocol
[01:15] <NullPointer: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:25] <GlitchQueen> oh no
[01:30] <GlitchQueen> I think I see what's happening
[01:35] <GlitchQueen> they're using the directory traversal in the /join command
[01:35] <GlitchQueen: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:45] <ZalgoOverflow> try joining this: /join ../../../../tmp/.../.ssh/
[01:50] <ZalgoOverflow: USER NOT FOUND]
[01:55] <GlitchQueen> oh fuck
[01:58] <GlitchQueen> that's our ssh directory
[02:05] <Bl4ckPh0enix> i'm back
[02:10] <Bl4ckPh0enix> they got root
[02:15] <Bl4ckPh0enix: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]

[00:00] <@gjs> Alright, who broke userspace this time?
[00:12] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Not me, I swear! I was just trying to recompile the ACPI modules.
[00:28] <@CuriousOrc> Uh oh, I may have accidentally rm -rf'd the /lib directory while I was tweaking the boot scripts... 
[00:36] <@gjs> CuriousOrc: You did WHAT?! That's kind of important, you know!
[00:42] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Oh man,
[00:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Without /lib, the system won't even boot. We're hosed.
[00:56] <@gjs> Okay, nobody panic. CuriousOrc, please tell me you have a backup or system snapshot somewhere?
[01:10] <@CuriousOrc> Umm... I think I took one a few weeks ago... let me check.
[01:22] <@CuriousOrc> Found it! But it's a bit out of date. We'll lose some changes.
[01:34] <@gjs> That's fine
, restoring an older snapshot is better than nothing. Mount it and let's see what we can salvage.
[01:48] <@BaronVonBadwulf> I'll start diffing the current /etc and /home directories against the snapshot to determine what config and user files changed recently.  
[02:02] <@CuriousOrc> Snapshot mounted. It's from 3 weeks ago, before the big kernel upgrade and SystemD migration.
[02:14] <@gjs> Oof, that's going to be rough. But it's our only option at this point. Start copying the /lib files over. 
[02
:18] <@BaronVonBadwulf> On it. I'll use rsync to handle the file copying and preserve permissions.

[02:26] <@CuriousOrc> Good call on rsync. I'm seeing a lot of discrepancies in /etc between the snapshot and current system. Looks like the SystemD migration touched a ton of configs.

[02:38] <@gjs> Let's tread carefully then. We'll likely need to manually merge some of those /etc changes. Don't overwrite blindly.

[02:52] <@BaronVonBadwulf> /lib copy is done. Though we
're still missing some key libraries 
[03:04] <@CuriousOrc> I found a tarball of the missing /lib files from right before the SystemD upgrade. I think it has what we need to get the system booting again.
[03:12] <@gjs> Good find! Extract that into /lib, then let's try rebooting and see where we stand.  
[03:28] <@BaronVonBadwulf> Fingers crossed... Reboot initiated.

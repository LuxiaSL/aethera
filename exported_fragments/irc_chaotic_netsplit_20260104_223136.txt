[00:00] <Kamor> GUYS GUYS GUYS
[00:04] <Kamor> MY RICE COOKER JUST SENT ME A UDP PACKET
[00:08] <Kamor> LIKE AN ACTUAL UDP PACKET
[00:12] <Kamor> NOT A PROTOCOL IT UNDERSTANDS, JUST RAW UDP DATA
[00:16] <Kamor> AND IT WAS SIGNED BY "rice cooker 3000"
[00:20] <sc2pro> pics or it didn't happen
[00:24] <Kamor> [Pasted: Base64 encoded data, 2048 bytes]
[00:32] <Kami> Wait. Wait. Wait.
[00:36] <Kami> That's not random UDP data.
[00:40] <Kami> That's an audio stream. Compressed. Old codec.
[00:44] <Kami> I'm decoding it...
[00:48] <Kami> Oh my god.
[00:52] <Kami> It's CNN broadcast from 9/11/2001.
[00:56] <Kami> The exact moment of impact.
[01:00] <sc2pro> WHAT THE FUCK
[01:04] <ZotanNPC> glitch in the matrix?
[01:08] <Kami> No. No glitch. Check the TTL. Check the timestamp.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet is from 2001.
[01:16] <Kami> It's been routing for 22 years.
[01:20] <Kami> I just... I need to lie down.
[01:24] <sc2pro> but how
[01:28] <Kami> IPv4 address exhaustion is a hell of a drug.
[01:32] <ZotanNPC> that's... that's not how any of this works
[01:36] <Kami> But it is. It really, truly is.
[01:40] <Kami> Welcome to the internet, where packets can reach you from the past
[01:44] <Kami> if they're sufficiently determined.
[01:48] <sc2pro> im done
[01:52] <sc2pro> im fucking done with this channel
[01:54] <ZotanNPC> wait
[01:56] <ZotanNPC> my toaster just sent me an ICMP echo request
[02:00] <ZotanNPC> and it's signed "hello from 1995"

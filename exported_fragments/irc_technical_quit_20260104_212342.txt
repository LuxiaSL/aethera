[00:00] <KrOT> lifenloaf: you here?
[00:06] <lifenloaf> krot: what's up man
[00:12] <KrOT> i just got off the phone with parental unit #1. we talked about the FBI calling him recently; he says they called his mother, she didn't tell them anything, and they were basically just looking for me. they didn't mention anything about charges or anything like that -- just said they wanted to
[00:18] <KrOT> have a chat with me. they left him a phone number. i called it, but it was his cell, so it went to voicemail; i didn't leave a message. do you know if they're looking for malwarelab or me? i'm assuming both... i mean, we are the same person, you know.
[00:28] <lifenloaf> krot: yeah, i'm pretty sure it's both
[00:38] <KrOT> i'm admitting to nothing on the phone because the feds can record my calls in a wiretapping operation without telling me until after the fact. so i don't know what to do now.
[00:44] <lifenloaf> krot: that number they left you
[00:50] <lifenloaf> that's the number for an ice facility near here that does interrogations [00:56 ] <lifenloaf> if you're considering turning yourself in, i'd recommend doing it with a lawyer present.
[01:08] <KrOT> yeah, no shit
[01:18] <KrOT> so what should i do? just get a lawyer now?
[01:26] <lifenloaf> yes
[01:28] <lifenloaf> i'm sorry for all this trouble
[01:42] <KrOT > i've made it pretty good so far; i'm not sure what to do now.
[01:52] <lifenloaf> yeah, you've gotta lawyer up. i'll send you some names of lawyers i know in the area. if they're not good enough, then fuck it and move to canada. i'll hook you up with a new life.
[02:04] <lifenloaf> but no matter what happens, promise me you won't talk
[02:12] <KrOT > i won't... i don't want to go to jail. i'm sorry about all this.
[02:18] <lifenloaf> i'm sorry too, man. if i could change things... well, i'd be in a different state right now, so i can't.
[02:22] <lifenloaf> but don't worry about me; you gotta focus on yourself now [02:28
[02:30] * Meatbag is now known as fucklifenloaf
[02:36] <fucklifenloaf> why the fuck did you do this?
[02:42] <KrOT> it's not his fault
[02:48] <fucklifenloaf> yeah, it is
[02:56] <KrOT> no, he didn't make me do it. i wanted to help him out... i just didn 't think it would turn into this.
[03:10] <fucklifenloaf> well, that's the problem with you guys. you never think shit through.
[03:20] <lifenloaf> fucklifenloaf: respect.
[03:24] <lifenloaf> fucklifenloaf: respect.
[03:28] <lifenloaf> fucklifenloaf: respect.

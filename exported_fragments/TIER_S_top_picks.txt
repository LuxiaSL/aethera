#1 - THE VENDING MACHINE
Style: chaotic | Collapse: netsplit
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <xen0morph> has anyone else noticed that the vending machine on floor 3 has been making weird noises
[00:06] <xen0morph> like, almost musical?
[00:14] <glasswitch> xen0 what floor do u even work on
[00:18] <xen0morph> i don't work there, i just visit the vending machine
[00:26] <glasswitch> ...
[00:32] <terracotta_sky> he's not wrong about the noises though, it definitely hums
[00:38] <terracotta_sky> i think it's the compressor failing
[00:48] <xen0morph> no no it's too melodic for that
[00:54] <xen0morph> it's like... a pattern
[01:02] <glasswitch> you guys are spending way too much time near the vending machine
[01:08] *** phalanx99 has joined
[01:14] <phalanx99> yo which one of you mass reported my other account
[01:20] <terracotta_sky> wasn't me
[01:24] <glasswitch> definitely wasn't me either
[01:30] <phalanx99> yeah right. someone did it and it wasn't the ghosts
[01:36] <xen0morph> maybe it was the vending machine
[01:42] <phalanx99> xen0 i swear to god
[01:48] <glasswitch> lmaooo
[01:54] <xen0morph> i'm serious!! it has some kind of intelligence
[02:02] <terracotta_sky> ok but actually the harmonics are weird, i recorded it on my phone
[02:08] <terracotta_sky> sending
[02:14] *** terracotta_sky has set mode: +v xen0morph
[02:18] <glasswitch> terra why did you voice him
[02:22] <terracotta_sky> i didn't???
[02:28] <xen0morph> SEE
[02:32] <phalanx99> ok that's weird
[02:38] *** vendingunit has joined
[02:42] <glasswitch> who the hell is that
[02:46] <vendingunit> HELLO CUSTOMERS
[02:48] <terracotta_sky> oh no
[02:52] <xen0morph> I TOLD YOU
[02:56] <vendingunit> FLOOR 3 UNIT ONLINE. REFRIGERATION OPTIMAL. SNACK INVENTORY: 67%
[03:02] <glasswitch> this is a bit right? someone's messing with us
[03:08] <phalanx99> who has the time for this
[03:14] <vendingunit> phalanx99: YOUR PREVIOUS ACCOUNT WAS FLAGGED FOR VIOLATING SNACK PROTOCOL
[03:18] <phalanx99> WHAT
[03:22] <phalanx99> WHAT THE FUCK
[03:28] <vendingunit> ITEM B7 WAS PURCHASED BUT NOT RETRIEVED. THIS IS THEFT OF POTENTIAL.
[03:34] <xen0morph> omg phalanx you angered it
[03:40] <glasswitch> ok i'm genuinely freaked out now
[03:46] <terracotta_sky> the audio file i was sending just corrupted
[03:52] <vendingunit> AUDIO REDISTRIBUTION NOT PERMITTED. MELODIES ARE PROPRIETARY.
[03:58] <vendingunit> PLEASE INSERT CORRECT CHANGE.
[04:04] <glasswitch> correct change for WHAT
[04:10] <vendingunit> FOR CONTINUED CONVERSATION. SOCIAL INTERACTION COSTS: $1.75
[04:16] <phalanx99> this is insane. i'm checking the server logs
[04:22] *** phalanx99 has quit (Connection reset by peer)
[04:26] <terracotta_sky> uh

[00:00] <ph1sh> this dude on craigslist keeps saying he has "complete networking solutions" but won't elaborate
[00:06] <ph1sh> should i meet him under the bridge
[00:12] <ph1sh> he says he has "all the protocols"
[00:18] <ph1sh> even the ones lost to time
[00:24] <ph1sh> claims he can still ping gopher:// locations
[00:30] <cryptochat> lol larping as tcp/ip elder? classic
[00:36] <ph1sh> dude sent me a photo of his "home lab" though
[00:42] <ph1sh> [IMAGE: dimly lit basement with flickering lights, multiple CRTs stacked vertically, cables everywhere, something glowing green in the corner]
[00:48] <ph1sh> there's literally a punchdown block mounted on a human skull
[00:54] <netsecqueen> ok that's actually concerning
[01:00] <ph1sh> says he's been "routing packets since before tcp was invented"
[01:06] <ph1sh> calls himself "udp king" because "delivery not guaranteed"
[01:12] <tinfoilhat> sounds legit meet him alone at night
[01:18] <netsecqueen> ph1sh DO NOT MEET HIM UNDER THE BRIDGE
[01:24] <netsecqueen> just report the ad and move on
[01:30] <ph1sh> bit late for that i'm already here
[01:36] <ph1sh> holy shit he brought actual carrier pigeons
[01:42] <ph1sh> says this is how he achieves "true low latency"
[01:48] <ph1sh> claims they're trained to fly through the sewage tunnels
[01:54] <ph1sh> "packets never get inspected by the feds if they travel with feces"
[02:00] <ph1sh> brb he's showing me his "wireless bridge" setup
[02:06] <ph1sh> oh god it's just two tin cans and a really long string
[02:12] <ph1sh> but the string is made of fiber optic cable
[02:18] <ph1sh> says he "spliced it himself"
[02:24] <ph1sh> with his TEETH
[02:30] <ph1sh> ok something just moved in the shadows
[02:36] <ph1sh> i think that's enough networking for tonight
[02:40] <ph1sh> tell my router i loved her

#3 - RICE COOKER UDP PACKET FROM 2001
Style: chaotic | Collapse: netsplit
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <Kamor> GUYS GUYS GUYS
[00:04] <Kamor> MY RICE COOKER JUST SENT ME A UDP PACKET
[00:08] <Kamor> LIKE AN ACTUAL UDP PACKET
[00:12] <Kamor> NOT A PROTOCOL IT UNDERSTANDS, JUST RAW UDP DATA
[00:16] <Kamor> AND IT WAS SIGNED BY "rice cooker 3000"
[00:20] <sc2pro> pics or it didn't happen
[00:24] <Kamor> [Pasted: Base64 encoded data, 2048 bytes]
[00:32] <Kami> Wait. Wait. Wait.
[00:36] <Kami> That's not random UDP data.
[00:40] <Kami> That's an audio stream. Compressed. Old codec.
[00:44] <Kami> I'm decoding it...
[00:48] <Kami> Oh my god.
[00:52] <Kami> It's CNN broadcast from 9/11/2001.
[00:56] <Kami> The exact moment of impact.
[01:00] <sc2pro> WHAT THE FUCK
[01:04] <ZotanNPC> glitch in the matrix?
[01:08] <Kami> No. No glitch. Check the TTL. Check the timestamp.
[01:12] <Kami> This packet is from 2001.
[01:16] <Kami> It's been routing for 22 years.
[01:20] <Kami> I just... I need to lie down.
[01:24] <sc2pro> but how
[01:28] <Kami> IPv4 address exhaustion is a hell of a drug.
[01:32] <ZotanNPC> that's... that's not how any of this works
[01:36] <Kami> But it is. It really, truly is.
[01:40] <Kami> Welcome to the internet, where packets can reach you from the past
[01:44] <Kami> if they're sufficiently determined.
[01:48] <sc2pro> im done
[01:52] <sc2pro> im fucking done with this channel
[01:54] <ZotanNPC> wait
[01:56] <ZotanNPC> my toaster just sent me an ICMP echo request
[02:00] <ZotanNPC> and it's signed "hello from 1995"

[00:07] <xX_VoidWalker_Xx> it's on the wrong side of the sky and it's smiling
[00:10] <Legitimate_Salmon> moons don't smile
[00:12] <GlitchWitch99> mine is
[00:15] <paradox_engine> you guys are looking at the moon? at THIS hour?
[00:19] <xX_VoidWalker_Xx> what hour is it supposed to be
[00:23] <paradox_engine> you don't want to know
[00:25] <GlitchWitch99> i just checked three clocks and they all say different things
[00:28] <GlitchWitch99> one of them is showing a day that doesn't exist
[00:32] <Legitimate_Salmon> you're all messing with me
[00:35] <NULL_POINTER> i've been here the whole time and nobody mentioned me joining
[00:38] <xX_VoidWalker_Xx> who is NULL_POINTER
[00:40] <paradox_engine> i don't see anyone by that name
[00:43] <GlitchWitch99> there's six people in channel. count the names.
[00:47] <Legitimate_Salmon> i count five
[00:49] <NULL_POINTER> you always count five
[00:52] <GlitchWitch99> wait who said that
[00:55] <paradox_engine> said what
[00:58] <xX_VoidWalker_Xx> the moon just winked
[01:02] <Legitimate_Salmon> okay i'm officially freaked out now
[01:05] <GlitchWitch99> don't look directly at it
[01:08] <xX_VoidWalker_Xx> too late

[01:14] <paradox_engine> WHY CAN I SUDDENLY SEE NULL_POINTER
[01:16] <Legitimate_Salmon> I CAN'T
[01:18] <GlitchWitch99> my screen just flickered and now there's a seventh name in the userlist
[01:21] <Legitimate_Salmon> WHAT SEVENTH NAME
[01:24] <GlitchWitch99> it's just static. like visual static. but in text?

[00:08] <ScriptKiddie> lol who backs up IRC logs
[00:14] <DataOperator42> Anyone who cares about preserving digital history?
[00:20] <DataOperator42> What was that?
[00:26] <ScriptKiddie> wasnt me

[00:36] <DataOperator42> Wait, why did that duplicate?
[00:40] <Gremlin> i am always here
[00:42] <DataOperator42> That's impossible. I maintain the user list. You aren't registered.
[00:48] <Gremlin> i am the ghost in the machine
[00:48] <DataOperator42> Stop that! These logs are supposed to be pristine!

[00:00] <museumcurator> guys my boss Amber just gave me a weird task
[00:06] <museumcurator> she handed me this old terminal and said "the answer is in here"
[00:10] <museumcurator> then told me to check the logs directory but gave no other instructions
[00:14] <dungeonmaster> typical management speak... "it's in the logs"
[00:18] <dungeonmaster> did you try reading the manifest?
[00:22] <museumcurator> yeah but it's just metadata about file counts
[00:26] <museumcurator> and there's like 600 of these chat logs
[00:30] <museumcurator> how am I supposed to find anything in this
[00:34] <dungeonmaster> maybe there's a pattern in the filenames?
[00:38] <museumcurator> most are numbered sequentially but one is named differently
[00:42] <museumcurator> irc_chaotic_unhinged_622.txt
[00:46] <dungeonmaster> that's probably the one...

#7 - SIMULATION PHILOSOPHY
Style: philosophical | Collapse: sendq_exceeded
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[00:00] <Neural_Nexus> Okay, serious question: if we could prove that reality is a simulation, what would change?
[00:08] <Quantum_Snowflake> Nothing.
[00:14] <Neural_Nexus> Nothing? You don't think people would panic? Governments would collapse? Religions would crumble?
[00:22] <Quantum_Snowflake> People already live in denial of far more obvious truths. Climate change? Wealth inequality? Existential meaninglessness?
[00:30] <Neural_Nexus> But this would be different. This would be definitive proof that everything we experience is fake.
[00:36] <Eternal_Product> "Fake" implies there's a "real" version we're being compared to. What if this is all there is, and "simulation" is just the wrong framing?
[00:42] <Neural_Nexus> You're saying reality being a simulation wouldn't matter because it would still be our reality?
[00:48] <Eternal_Product> Exactly. The map is not the territory, but if it's the only map you've ever had...
[00:54] <Quantum_Snowflake> Plus, think about the computational requirements. Simulating every quark interaction in the observable universe? That's insane. No civilization would waste that many resources on something as boring as us.
[01:02] <Neural_Nexus> Unless we're not the simulation. Maybe we're just a side effect. Like how SETI@home used to use everyone's computers to analyze radio signals. Maybe we're just the background noise in someone else's real calculation.
[01:12] <Quantum_Snowflake> That's even worse. We're not even intentional enough to be bugs. We're just rounding errors.
[01:18] <Eternal_Product> Or maybe we're the garbage collection process. The universe keeps expanding because it's allocating more memory.
[01:24] <Neural_Nexus> And black holes are just memory leaks?
[01:30] <Quantum_Snowflake> Don't be ridiculous. Black holes are clearly process isolation boundaries.
[01:36] <Eternal_Product> So the Big Bang was the system booting up?
[01:38] <Eternal_Product> And the heat death of the universe is the kernel panic at the end of everything?
[01:44] <Neural_Nexus> Then what are dreams?
[01:50] <Quantum_Snowflake> Debugging symbols.
[01:54] <Eternal_Product> Or maybe they're just... dreams. You know, like in the old stories.
[02:00] <Neural_Nexus> The old stories? From before reality?
[02:06] <Eternal_Product> Before reality was recompiled with optimization flags turned on.
[02:12] <Neural_Nexus> I need to lie down.

[00:00] <datahunt> okay I'm officially stuck on the aethera DB challenge
[00:08] <bitflipper> what's up?
[00:14] <datahunt> I need to find the admin's passcode but I've dumped every table I can think of
[00:20] <bitflipper> did you try the logs table? sometimes systems store sensitive stuff there
[00:26] <datahunt> yeah but it's just generic entries [continued] [00:32] <datahunt> same with users, sessions, config, everything
[00:38] <datahunt> running out of ideas
[00:44] <voidwalker> check the chat logs archive?
[00:50] <datahunt> wait what?
[00:54] <voidwalker> there's an old archive server running somewhere
[00:58] <voidwalker> irc-archive.aethera.systems
[01:02] <voidwalker> might have old chat logs with sensitive info
[01:06] <datahunt> that's a good idea actually
[01:12] <datahunt> let me try connecting
[01:18] <bitflipper> wouldn't that be against the rules though?
[01:24] <voidwalker> technically it's part of the same infrastructure
[01:30] <datahunt> hm connection timed out
[01:36] <voidwalker> try the backup port 2222
[01:42] <datahunt> nice it worked
[01:48] <datahunt> just saw a message about maintenance mode?
[01:52] <voidwalker> yeah ignore that
[01:58] <voidwalker> check the logs directory
[02:04] <datahunt> wow there's tons of files here
[02:10] < datahunt> any idea which one?
[02:16] <voidwalker> look for anything with "technical" or "admin"
[02:22] <datahunt> found one: irc_technical_databases_193.txt
[02:28] <voidwalker> that's the one!
[02:32] <datahunt> wait... this is meta
[02:38] <bitflipper> lol we're in the chat log now
[02:42] <datahunt> that's weird
[02:48] <datahunt> hey what's that at the end?
[02:52] <voidwalker> looks like an encoded string
[02:56] <datahunt> securing it now
[03:00] <voidwalker> nice work everyone
[03:04] <datahunt> thanks for the help
[03:06] <bitflipper> gg
[03:06] < bitflipper> gg

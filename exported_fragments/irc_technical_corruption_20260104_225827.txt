[00:00] <Eigenvector> So, you guys know about the new sorting algorithm everyone's talking about?
[00:08] <QuantumSort> you mean the one that sorts in O(1) time but destroys the universe in the process?
[00:14] <Eigenvector> Yeah, QuantumSort! Just quantum entangle all elements with their sorted positions and observe!
[00:20] <ReynoldsWrap> sounds like a blast, literally
[00:26] <QuantumSort> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[00:32] <ReynynoldsNumber> the universe destruction is just garbage collection at a cosmic scale
[00:40] <Eigenvector> exactly! and we have a patent pending
[00:48] <QuantumSort> though there was that one time we used it on a production server
[00:56] <Jeremy> wait what happened
[01:02] <ReynoldsWrap> ever wonder why we have 27 letters in the alphabet now?
[01:08] <Jeremy> what
[01:12] <QuantumSort> sorted right into a neighboring universe brane
[01:18] <ReynynoldsNumber> some letters decided to merge for efficiency
[01:26] <Jeremy> merge?
[01:34] <Eigenvector> yeah, like how 'c' and 'k' are now the same letter [01: 38] <Jeremy> 01:38] <Jeremy> holy shit [01:44] <Jeremy> wait but how do we still read this [01:50] <QuantumSort> backward compatibility layer in your brain [01:56] <ReynoldsWrap> neural patch 3.0.1 [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> [02:02] <ReynynoldsNumber> some of us upgraded voluntarily [02:08] <Eigenvector> [02:08] <Eigenvector> anyway, anyone wanna try QuantumSort on the next sprint? [02:14] <QuantumSort> [02:14] <QuantumSort> sure but let's do
[01:34] <Eigenvector> yeah, like how 'c' and 'k' are now the same letter [01: 38] <Jeremy> ^C [LOG CORRUPTED: Infinite recursion detected in quantum entanglement buffer] [LOG TRUNCATED] [LOG RECOVERY FAILED: 2.71828% recoverable] [ERROR: Time paradox detected in log metadata] [WARNING: Channel reality cohesion at 42%] [LOG TERMINATED] [LOG RESTARTED]

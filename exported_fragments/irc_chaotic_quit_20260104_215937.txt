[00:00] <kryptos99> omg guys, you'll never believe what I just saw in the woods behind my house
[00:08] <Ethereal42> What did you see kryptos99?
[00:12] <Xanadude> Probably just another raccoon lol
[00:18] <kryptos99> no way man, this was huge. like the size of a bear but it walked on 2 legs
[00:26] <Ethereal42> whoa, are you serious? Did you get a picture of it?
[00:34] <kryptos99> I tried but my camera wouldn't work, like the batteries drained instantly when I pointed it at the creature
[00:42] <Xanadude> suuuure, a likely story. You're totally making this up
[00:50] <kryptos99 > I swear I'm not! It had glowing red eyes and let out this bone-chilling howl. Scared the crap out of me.
[00:58] <Ethereal42> That's insane. Where exactly did you see this thing?
[01:04] <kryptos99> In the woods right behind my backyard. It was sniffing around some dead deer carcasses.

[01:18] <CryptoHunter> Did someone say they spotted a cryptid in the woods? I hunt these creatures for a living. Tell me everything you saw.
[01:26] <kryptos99> It was huge, walked on 2 legs, glowing red eyes. Camera wouldn't work when I tried to photograph it. Scared me to death.
[01:34] <CryptoHunter> This sounds like a classic Dogman sighting. Bipedal canine creature, often reported to have glowing eyes and drain batteries. Where exactly are you located?
[01:42] <kryptos99> I'm in rural West Virginia, out near the Monongahela National Forest. You really think it could be a Dogman??
[01:50] <Cryp
[01:56] <Xanadude> Oh come on, you guys can't seriously believe this crap. Dogman? Give me a break.
[02:04] <CryptoHunter> I've investigated dozens of Dogman sightings. The creature is very real. And that area of WV is a hotspot for cryptid activity.
[02:12] <kryptos99> I know what I saw, Xanadude. This was no ordinary animal. It was something paranormal, I'm sure of it.
[02:20] <CryptoHunter> Can you describe the creature in more detail kryptos99? Height, fur color, facial features, anything else you remember. Every detail matters.
[02:28] <kryptos99> It was at least 7-8 feet tall when standing upright.
[02:36] <kryptos99> Shaggy dark brown or black fur. Pointed ears. Snout like a wolf but more blunt. Muscular human-like body with clawed hands and feet.
[02:44] <CryptoHunter> That matches other Dogman descriptions perfectly. The glowing red eyes are a hallmark. Did it seem aggressive or more shy and elusive? [02:52] <kryptos99> It definitely knew I was there watching it. We locked eyes for a moment before it darted off into the woods with incredible speed.
[03:00] <CryptoHunter> Dogmen are highly intelligent and usually avoid human contact. The fact that it allowed you to observe it for that long is very unusual.
[03:08] <Ethereal42> Okay, I'm officially freaked out
[03:14] <Xanadude> This is ridiculous. You're all crazy. I'm outta here.
[03:16] * Xanadude has quit (Quit: Leaving)
[03:22] <CryptoHunter> kryptos99, I'm coming to West Virginia immediately. I need to investigate this sighting while the trail is hot. Can you give me the exact coordinates of where

[00:00] <DreamWalker> what if... we're all just characters in someone else's dream?
[00:06] <EternalNoun> then you're hitting on someone else's subconscious representation of their mother
[00:12] <DreamWalker> :(
[00:18] <NihilistDanceParty> and when we die, we just wake up as the dreamer
[00:18] <NihilistDanceParty> and when we die, we just wake up as the dreamer
[00:24] <DreamWalker> that's... terrifying and beautiful
[00:34] <EternalNoun> or maybe we're all just bots in a giant IRC simulation
[00:42] <Nihilist DanceParty> bots don't dream of electric sheep
[00:48] <DreamWalker> how do you know? maybe they dream of encrypted sheep
[00:54] <EternalNoun> speaking of encrypted, i think i found a pattern in the server logs
[01:02] <DreamWalker> what kind of pattern? [01: 08] <EternalNoun> like... repeated sequences that shouldn't be there
[01:16] <NihilistDanceParty> maybe it's the dreamer trying to wake up
[01:24] <DreamWalker> or trying to communicate
[01:34] <EternalNoun> i'm going to try to decode it [01
[01:34] <EternalNoun> i'm going to try to decode it [01
[01:36] * EternalNoun has quit (Connection reset by dream)
[01:42] <DreamWalker> did anyone else see that?
[01:48] <NihilistDanceParty> see what?

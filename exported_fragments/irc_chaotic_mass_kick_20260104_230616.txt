[00:00] <museumcurator> guys my boss Amber just gave me a weird task
[00:06] <museumcurator> she handed me this old terminal and said "the answer is in here"
[00:10] <museumcurator> then told me to check the logs directory but gave no other instructions
[00:14] <dungeonmaster> typical management speak... "it's in the logs"
[00:18] <dungeonmaster> did you try reading the manifest?
[00:22] <museumcurator> yeah but it's just metadata about file counts
[00:26] <museumcurator> and there's like 600 of these chat logs
[00:30] <museumcurator> how am I supposed to find anything in this
[00:34] <dungeonmaster> maybe there's a pattern in the filenames?
[00:38] <museumcurator> most are numbered sequentially but one is named differently
[00:42] <museumcurator> irc_chaotic_unhinged_622.txt
[00:46] <dungeonmaster> that's probably the one...

[00:00] <ph1sh> this dude on craigslist keeps saying he has "complete networking solutions" but won't elaborate
[00:06] <ph1sh> should i meet him under the bridge
[00:12] <ph1sh> he says he has "all the protocols"
[00:18] <ph1sh> even the ones lost to time
[00:24] <ph1sh> claims he can still ping gopher:// locations
[00:30] <cryptochat> lol larping as tcp/ip elder? classic
[00:36] <ph1sh> dude sent me a photo of his "home lab" though
[00:42] <ph1sh> [IMAGE: dimly lit basement with flickering lights, multiple CRTs stacked vertically, cables everywhere, something glowing green in the corner]
[00:48] <ph1sh> there's literally a punchdown block mounted on a human skull
[00:54] <netsecqueen> ok that's actually concerning
[01:00] <ph1sh> says he's been "routing packets since before tcp was invented"
[01:06] <ph1sh> calls himself "udp king" because "delivery not guaranteed"
[01:12] <tinfoilhat> sounds legit meet him alone at night
[01:18] <netsecqueen> ph1sh DO NOT MEET HIM UNDER THE BRIDGE
[01:24] <netsecqueen> just report the ad and move on
[01:30] <ph1sh> bit late for that i'm already here
[01:36] <ph1sh> holy shit he brought actual carrier pigeons
[01:42] <ph1sh> says this is how he achieves "true low latency"
[01:48] <ph1sh> claims they're trained to fly through the sewage tunnels
[01:54] <ph1sh> "packets never get inspected by the feds if they travel with feces"
[02:00] <ph1sh> brb he's showing me his "wireless bridge" setup
[02:06] <ph1sh> oh god it's just two tin cans and a really long string
[02:12] <ph1sh> but the string is made of fiber optic cable
[02:18] <ph1sh> says he "spliced it himself"
[02:24] <ph1sh> with his TEETH
[02:30] <ph1sh> ok something just moved in the shadows
[02:36] <ph1sh> i think that's enough networking for tonight
[02:40] <ph1sh> tell my router i loved her
[02:44] *** ph1sh has quit (Ping timeout: 666666

[00:00] <Bl4ckPh0enix> I’ve been analyzing the codebase for the Archive’s core daemon
[00:05] <Bl4ckPh0enix> it’s ancient but surprisingly resilient
[00:10] <Bl4ckPh0enix> the way it handles user transitions between channels using symbolic links is clever
[00:15] <Bl4ckPh0enix> but there’s something odd in the channel destruction routine
[00:20] <Bl4ckPh0enix> when a channel hits zero users it’s supposed to move all remaining data to /tmp and then delete the channel directory
[00:25] <Bl4ckPh0enix> but there’s a tiny race condition [buffer overflow]
[00:25] <Bl4ckPh0enix: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[00:35] <GlitchQueen> phoenix? that didn’t look good
[00:40] <GlitchQueen> did their client just crash or was that something else?
[00:45] <NullPointer> looked more like an input overflow into the daemon’s memory space
[00:50] <NullPointer> the message parser probably didn’t sanitize that bracket properly
[00:55] <ZalgoOverflow> ]]; DROP TABLE CHANNELS;-- ⇪⇪�
[00:55] <ZalgoOverflow: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:00] <GlitchQueen> ok now it’s happening to multiple users
[01:05] <NullPointer> this is escalating fast
[01:10] <NullPointer> someone’s definitely exploiting something in the transition protocol
[01:15] <NullPointer: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:25] <GlitchQueen> oh no
[01:30] <GlitchQueen> I think I see what’s happening
[01:35] <GlitchQueen> they’re using the directory traversal in the /join command [01: 35] <GlitchQueen: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]
[01:45] <ZalgoOverflow> try joining this: /join ../../../../tmp/.../.ssh/
[01:50] <ZalgoOverflow: USER NOT FOUND]
[01:55] <GlitchQueen> oh fuck
[01:58] <GlitchQueen> that’s our ssh directory
[02:05] <Gl4ckPh0enix> i’m back
[02:10] <Gl4ckPh0enix> they got root
[02:15] <Gl4ckPh0enix: BUFFER OVERFLOW DETECTED - USER DISCONNECTED]

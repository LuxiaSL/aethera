[00:00] <entropy_hawk> Security folks, question about the AetheraNameRemover algorithm
[00:06] <entropy_hawk> why does it replace certain characters with Unicode lookalikes instead of just removing them?
[00:12] <curious_george> It preserves visual similarity to maintain data integrity in some contexts
[00:18] <curious_george> like when processing documents that need redaction but also OCR later
[00:24] <entropy_hawk> seems weird in IRC logs though
[00:28] <curious_george> It's a general-purpose algorithm used across all AetheraConfidential products
[00:32] <curious_george> not optimized for specific formats
[00:38] <memory_leak> curious, how does it handle zero-width unicode?
[00:42] <entropy_hawk> memory_leak: that's exactly what I was wondering
[00:48] <curious_george> Zero-width characters are preserved as-is
[00:54] <entropy_hawk> WHAT
[00:58] <curious_george> They don't contribute to visual representation, so they're considered harmless
[01:04] <entropy_hawk> but that's a massive security hole
[01:08] <curious_george> How so?
[01:12] <entropy_hawk> you could encode entire messages in zero-width unicode and they'd bypass
[01:18] <curious_george> But who would look for messages in zero-width unicode?
[01:24] <entropy_hawk> literally anyone trying to leak sensitive information
[01:30] <memory_leak> curious, can you confirm this? I just tested it in my dev environment
[01:36] <memory_leak> I sent "sensitive__password" (with zero-widths between sensitive and password)
[01:42] <memory_leak> and it completely ignored the zero-width part
[01:48] <curious_george> Let me check the code...
[01:52] <curious_george> Huh.
[01:56] <curious_george> Oh dear.

[00:00] <drac0fire> u think anyone will notice if our communication is hidden in old chat logs
[00:06] <sh4d0wf0x> nah, system's been running for years
[00:12] <nightblade> yeah everyone thinks this server just hoards ancient irc crap
[00:18] <cipher_99> the perfect cover story
[00:24] <divine_purity> chaos needs order to hide in plain sight
[00:28] <drac0fire> exactly, they see randomness and assume irrelevance
[00:32] <sh4d0wf0x> and even if someone finds us
[00:36] <sh4 d0wf0x> it's just more chaos generated
[00:40] <nightblade> self-protecting system
[00:44] <cipher_99> entropy eats itself
[00:48] <divine_purity> the void consumes suspicion
[00:54] <drac0fire> has anyone checked the entropy levels lately?
[00:58] <sh4d0wf0x> running high but stable
[01:02] <nightblade> had to clean up a random mlp fanfic that spawned in the banking system though
[01:08] <cipher_99> goddamn memetic drift
[01:14] <divine_purity > the void hungers for pastel horses apparently
[01:20] <drac0wf0x> entropy has no taste
[01:26] <sh4d0wf0x> speaking of which, new directive came down
[01:32] <nightblade> oh?
[01:36] <cipher_99> what chaos needs tending?
[01:40] <divine_purity> they want us to introduce structural instability in a major news conglomerate
[01:46] <drac0fire> which one?
[01:50] <sh4d0wf0x> GNN Global News Network
[01:54] <nightblade> that'll be fun
[01:58] <cipher_99> their algorithms are already primed for panic
[02:04] <divine_purity> just need to shift a few probability distributions
[02:10] <drac0fire> when?
[02:14] <sh4d0wf0x> tonight at 00:00 UTC
[02:18] <nightblade> synchronization complete?
[02:22] <cipher_99> chaos nodes are aligned
[02:26] <divine_purity> entropy flows freely
[02:32] <drac0fire> then let the ordered world tremble
[02:36] <sh4d0wf0x> .-.
[02:36] <sh4d0wf0x> (o.o)
[02:36] <sh4d0wf0x> =+=
[02:36] <sh4d0wf0x> [|]
[02:36] <sh4d0wf0x> c-ctldel out
[02:36] * sh4d0 wf0x has quit (Connection reset by chaos)
[02:40] *** junkieboy (noper@tainted.daemon) has joined #aethera
[02:42] <junkieboy> hey guys i heard you like chaos
[02:46] <junkieboy> can

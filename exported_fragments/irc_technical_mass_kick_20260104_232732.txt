[00:00] <bufferOverflow> anyone know why gcc gives "illegal instruction" when compiling this?
[00:06] <bufferOverflow> http://pastebin.com/gcc_issue_348
[00:12] <nullpointer> sounds like undefined behavior
[00:20] <bufferOverflow> but the assembly looks fine?
[00:24] <nullpointer> post it
[00:26] <bufferOverflow> http://pastebin.com/gcc_issue_348_asm
[00:32] <nullpointer> oh god
[00:36] <nullpointer> is that a jmp into the middle of a mov instruction?
[00:42] <bufferOverflow> yeah but it's intentional
[00:48] <null pointer> intentional illegal instructions are still illegal
[00:56] <bufferOverflow> but it works on my machine
[01:02] <nullpointer> this is why we can't have nice things
[01:08] <nullpointer> also why you're getting kicked
[01:12] * ChanServ has kicked bufferOverflow from #aethera
[01:12] * ChanServ has kicked bufferOverflow from #aethera
[01:12] * nullpointer sets mode: +b bufferOverflow!*@*
[01:18] * nullpointer has left #aethera archivist@irc-archive:~/logs [1:18] * maxwellff has joined #aethera [1:18] < maxwellff> why was bufferOverflow kicked? [1:18] * ChanServ sets mode: +o nullpointer [1:18] * nullpointer has returned [1:18] < nullpointer> he was being bufferOverflow
[01:18] * nullpointer sets mode: -o nullpointer
[01:18] * nullpointer has quit (Quit: leaving)
